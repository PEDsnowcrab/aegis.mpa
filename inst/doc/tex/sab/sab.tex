\section*{Abstract}

We begin the dialogue required to develop a framework for monitoring and assessing spatially managed areas such as Marine Protected Areas (MPA). In particular, we begin with the Ocean's Act requirement to describe productivity, biodiversity, habitat and species of interest by identifying pragmatic metrics of these ecosystem-level attributes from pre-existing monitoring systems in the area of interest: St. Anns Bank in the Maritimes Region of Canada. We also identify a few human influences/pressures that are also readily quantified, namely fishing and vessel activity and some of the data gaps that evident in the area. The nature of these data and the steps required to use them properly are made explicit in an open-sourced and revision-controlled environment (R and git) for the purpose of developing a transparent, vetted data and code system from which future assessment and modeling attempts can be staged. This should reduce the replication of effort in future. The rationale for the methods chosen to quantify the characteristic space and time scales of processes and features are identified and discussed. Ultimately, the intent is to develop approaches similar to the risk-based approach frequently encountered in fishery stock assessments, such that we can begin to express the "status" of an area or MPA. It is perhaps even possible to attempt to define reference points and obtain a better sense of the "health" of these areas, or at least assess the relative influence of area-based management closures. This first report will focus only upon the "Data" side of the issues and clarify the proposed "Methods".

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Terms of reference}
The Health of the Oceans (2007; \url{http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/sds-sdd/sea-ees/hoto-sdo-eng.htm}) initiative and the National Conservation Plan (2014; \url{https://www.ec.gc.ca/ee-ea}) support the conservation and restoration of lands and waters in Canada. In this context, the Science Branch of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), has been tasked with developing a monitoring approach for Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and, if possible, to assess their effectiveness in meeting their objectives. 

\subsection{Scope of this report}
An MPA is defined in the Oceans Act 35(1) as, "An area of the sea that forms part of the internal waters of Canada, the territorial sea of Canada or the exclusive economic zone of Canada and has been designated under this section for special protection for one or more of the following reasons: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item the \textit{conservation and protection} of commercial and non-commercial fishery resources, including marine mammals, and their habitats; 
  \item the \textit{conservation and protection} of endangered or threatened marine species, and their habitats; 
  \item the \textit{conservation and protection} of unique habitats; 
  \item the \textit{conservation and protection} of marine areas of high biodiversity or biological productivity; 
  \item the \textit{conservation and protection} of any other marine resource or habitat as is necessary to fulfill the mandate of the Minister.
\end{itemize}

As a result, for the purposes of this report, we will likewise focus upon these key ecosystem attributes or components, namely: \textbf{productivity, biodiversity, habitat, and  species of interest}. In reality, however, there are many other attributes or components of ecosystems that are also known to be important and relevant, including: ecological integrity and health, trophic structure and balance, ecosystem function, complexity, network structure, resilience, sustainability as well an open-ended number of species or life history stages of the resident species. These other components will be touched upon where possible or necessary. 

\subsection{St. Anns Bank}
The St. Anns Bank Marine Protected Area (herein, SAB) is an area of interest for eventual designation as an MPA. It is located east of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada (Figure~\ref{fig:SABCloseup}). Previous advisory processes \parencites{DFO:2012:conservation, Kenchington:2013:sab}, identified the primary objectives of SAB as being to conserve, protect and where appropriate restore, ecologically distinctive or significant areas, and overall, the ecosystem "health" of SAB. As in the Oceans Act, the focus was upon the above four ecosystem components: \textbf{productivity, biodiversity, habitat and species of interest}.

Other MPA goals were also expressed in \textcite{DFO:2012:conservation} and \textcite{Kenchington:2013:sab}, but these were less emphatic:

\begin{itemize}
	\item contribute to the health, resilience and restoration of the Eastern Scotian Shelf ecosystem;
	\item contribute to the recovery and sustainability of commercial fisheries; 
	\item promote scientific research and monitoring to further understand and protect SAB.
\end{itemize}

\textcite{Ford:2013:sab} make more precise the ecological components that the SAB area of interest might help to protect and conserve, especially in the context of the Oceans Act's definition of MPAs:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Commercial and non-commercial fishery resources, including marine mammals, and their habitats (e.g., habitat for Atlantic cod, redfish, American plaice, sea urchins, white hake, witch flounder, sea anemones, sponges, and sea pens);
  \item Endangered or threatened marine species, and their habitats (e.g., habitat for depleted species such as Atlantic wolffish, Atlantic cod, and leatherback turtles);
  \item Unique habitats (it is the only major bank on the Inner Scotian Shelf);
  \item Marine areas of high biodiversity or biological productivity of invertebrates and fish.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Objectives}

The \textbf{primary objectives} of this report are straightforward:

\begin{itemize}
	\item To develop an Assessment Framework that can:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item	monitor the status of an MPA;
  	\item assess the effectiveness of an MPA in meeting its conservation objectives;
  \end{itemize}
  \item to identify data gaps and sources of uncertainty. 
\end{itemize}

The method by which this can be accomplished, however, is anything but straightforward. This is primarily due to the fact that the SAB is:

\begin{itemize}
	\item a large ecosystem and as such complex, operating at various space, time and organizational scales;
	\item connected in various ways to the surrounding environment and so cannot be treated as an isolated system;
	\item measures of system components of interest, namely, productivity, biodiversity, habitat and species of interest, are ambiguous and imperfect at best, and usually non-existent or poor in information quality and/or quantity.
\end{itemize}


As such, we emphasize that this report is a simplistic first attempt at developing a general approach towards assessing MPAs. Indeed, given the above significant challenges, it is best viewed as a work in progress that will require further precision and improvement. To this end, we will in the following, describe the data used for the assessment (Section \ref{sec:data}); outline the methods and assumptions associated with the modeling of this data (Section \ref{sec:methods}); summarize the primary results of this analysis (Section \ref{sec:results}); provide some discussion of salient points (Section \ref{sec:discussion}); and conclude with general recommendations (Section \ref{sec:conclusions}). The technical aspects of data quality assurance (QA)/quality control (QC), associated assumptions and methods are identified in the Appendices. 

\medskip

\textbf{NOTE: The primary purpose of this document is Section 2 (data) and to begin a discussion of Section 3 (proposed methods). There are no Results nor Conclusions to report at this point. }

\section{Data} 
\label{sec:data}

In this section we focus upon a description of the data chosen for inclusion in this assessment. The purpose of the section is basic: to clearly identify the data, sampling design, and the associated assumptions and methods required/used to filter and integrate them in an informative manner. 

For the sake of transparency, all data assimilation and QA/QC methods have been encoded in an open-sourced analytical environment R \parencite{rCran} and made publicly accessible at \url{https://bitbucket.org/ecomod/} (packages under development) and \url{https://bitbucket.org/Maritimes/} (packages thare are production-ready) to permit flexible and adaptive multiuser contributions through the \textbf{Git} revision control system and a uniform data interface system. This approach permits the development of a coherent and vetted approach that is completely opensource in nature. In this way, we see this project as a real and flexible \textbf{structural and collaborative framework} in the sense of a real scaffolding, to build a monitoring and assessment system that can be easily transfered to other Regions, domains and mandates as well as fostering collaborations and communication with universities and the general public. 

\subsection{Study area}
Evaluating MPA status and effectiveness in meeting conservation objectives, requires explicit reference to changes both within and without the area of interest. Even in the most basic BACI-type design, this requirement is explicit \parencite{green:1979, underwood1992}. For this reason, and also to facilitate evaluations of other potential MPAs in the region, a much larger surrounding area was chosen for analytical purposes. This area is the continental shelf region off Nova Scotia (Figure~\ref{fig:SAB}), bounded by latitudes 37N to 48N and longitudes from 48W to 71W. [Note: It should be emphasized that this will not alleviate problems associated with pseudo-(spatial, temporal) replication \parencite{hurlbert1984pseudoreplication}, although an assumption of a Gaussian process (see Sections \ref{sec:interpolationSpatial}, \ref{sec:spacetime}) may potentially alleviate this problem.]

  \label{fig:SAB}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Data selection criteria}
Exhaustive surveys of available data have been compiled by \textcite{Ford:2013:sab}. Their conclusions were that most biological data and environmental conditions are poorly sampled in the SAB area. The decision criteria for inclusion of data in this study was as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Part of an \textbf{on-going sampling} program. This is because the design principle behind this project is that the underlying assessment must smoothly transition into a routine monitoring approach into the future.
  \item	Sufficient and regular \textbf{spatial} coverage ($>$ 100 sampling locations) inside MPA and throughout the study area.
  \item Sufficient and regular \textbf{temporal} coverage ($\sim$ annual, $>$~10 years) inside MPA and throughout the study area.
  \item \textbf{Informative} -- high data quality that is in some manner related to productivity, biodiversity, habitat and species of interest.
\end{itemize}

The same decision criteria were applied to human usage data. The result was to include the following data streams for MPA characterisation:

\begin{itemize}
  \item AZMP/chlorophyll-a and nutrients: BioChem bottle data  \parencite{DFO:2014:biochem}
  \item AZMP/Zooplankton: BioChem database \parencite{DFO:2014:biochem}
  \item Remote Sensing Data: ocean colour and SST (Remote Sensing Group)
  \item Groundfish: DFO's Groundfish Research Vessel Surveys focus upon demersal fish species, since $\sim$ 2000, upon invertebrates as well
  \item Snow crab survey, focus upon benthic invertebrates
  \item Clam survey data in Banquereau and Western Banks (though it does not pass the temporal coverage conditions, it offers very high resolution multispecies data on the banks)
  \item Temperature records: from various sources, especially, Groundfish, Snow crab and AZMP surveys
  \item Salinity (Groundfish surveys/AZMP, BioChem)
  \item Oxygen and pH (once the data have been reloaded; Groundfish surveys/AZMP, BioChem)
  \item Bathymetry (CHS, Groundfish survey, Snow crab survey )
\end{itemize}

To characterise human usage patterns, the following have been chosen for inclusion:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Logbook records of catch and effort (MARFIS/ZIFF)
  \item AIS tracks -- Radio-based Automatic Identification System
  \item VMS potentially -- Satellite-based Vessel Monitoring System
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discrete Bottle Data: Chlorophyll-a and Nutrients}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Relevance: productivity, biodiversity, habitat and species of interest (in relative order)
  \item Sampling: AZMP surveys, Groundfish surveys, pelagic net tows and water profiles
  \item Spatial coverage: variable no. stations, 143,499 records, 829 missions
  \item Temporal coverage: 1955 to present, annual surveys
  \item Source code: \url{https://bitbucket.org/ecomod/aegis/blob/master/inst/scripts/biochem.r}
\end{itemize}

Discrete bottle data consisting of chlorophyll-a and nutrient records (nitrate, phosphate and silicate) were obtained by laboratory analysis of water samples collected at discrete depths. For this study all available nutrient and chlorophyll-a discrete bottle data were extracted from DFO's BioChem database for the study area. This dataset contains more than 500,000 records with the earliest records starting in 1955. After QA/QC, the discrete bottle data retained for analysis was comprised of 143,499 profiles, collected on 829 missions (Figure~\ref{fig:BottleMap}).

The number of profiles available in each year (Figure~\ref{fig:ChloroMap}) shows that there were few profiles taken until the mid 60's, and a relatively steady number of yearly profiles after the initiation of the Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program (AZMP) in 1999. The peak sampling during the period 1976-1982 corresponds to DFO's Scotian Shelf Ichthyoplankton Program (SSIP) and foreign research vessels sampling programs which were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Oceanographic Data Center (Pierre Clement, personal communication).  Monthly distribution of the profiles (Figure~\ref{fig:ChloroFreq})  demonstrates that most of the data was collected in July (mostly during DFO's groundfish surveys), followed by the months of September and April. Note that spatial distribution of the sampling varies among months with most data collected on the Scotian Shelf in July and the fewest data in January (Figures~\ref{fig:BottleMap}, \ref{fig:ChloroProfiles}.)

\subsection{Zooplankton Data}

\begin{itemize}  
  \item Relevance:  productivity, biodiversity, species of interest, habitat (in relative order)
  \item Sampling:  AZMP surveys, Groundfish surveys, pelagic net tows, 400 taxonomic species
  \item Spatial coverage: 2367 net deployments, 126 missions 
  \item Temporal coverage:,  1999 to 2014, annual surveys
  \item Source code: https://bitbucket.org/ecomod/aegis/blob/master/inst/scripts/biochem.r
\end{itemize}

Number of net deployments for each month is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:AZMPdeploymentsMonthly} and the corresponding spatial distribution of the net deployments are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:AZMPdeploymentsMonthlyMap}. Note that most of the net data were collected in July during summer groundfish survey missions and in April and October on AZMP spring and fall missions while winter months contain mostly fixed station data (Halifax 2 and Prince 5).

Abundance patterns are found in Figure~\ref{fig:AZMPBiomassMonthly}.

\subsection{Remote Sensing Data} 

\paragraph{Ocean Colour}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Relevance:  productivity, habitat, biodiversity and species of interest (in relative order) 
  \item Sampling:  MODIS
  \item Spatial coverage: 39 N to 62.5 N and 42 W to 71 W, resolution of 1.5 km
  \item Temporal coverage: August 2002 to March 2015, 610 quarter-monthly (8-day) composite  images
  \item Source code: \url{https://bitbucket.org/ecomod/aegis/blob/master/inst/scripts/remoting.sensing.r}
\end{itemize}

Ocean colour refers to the spectral distribution of light emerging from the ocean which carries information about water constituents, particularly about biologically useful chlorophyll concentration in the surface layer. When measured from satellites it provides unique synoptic view of chlorophyll spatial distribution over large areas of the ocean on a daily time scale.

The nominal uncertainty of chlorophyll products derived from ocean colour satellites is 35\%, with better agreement with in-situ chlorophyll for the open ocean \parencite{moore2008impacts} while overestimation is often observed in the coastal ocean \parencite{darecki2004evaluation}. This is due to the inability of the algorithms to distinguish chlorophyll from suspended particulate matter and colored dissolved organic matter often present in the coastal waters, as for example in the Bay of Fundy and Northumberland Strait.

Ocean colour satellite data for this study was provided by the Remote Sensing Unit (RSU) from the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO) as 8-day composite chlorophyll images which are routinely produced by the unit for the Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program (AZMP). The dataset was created using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua) data, where the chlorophyll-a values are based on the 2012 reprocessing carried by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) using OC3 chlorophyll algorithm. Composite images were created from daily Level-2 MODIS-Aqua files downloaded from NASA by averaging valid chlorophyll-a values for each pixel using all available daily images within that time period \parencite{Caverhill:2015:modis,feldman:2015}. The dataset comprises years 2002 to 2015 and area 39 N to 62.5 N and 42 W to 71 W, with spatial resolution of about 1.5 km per pixel. 

Even though there is ocean color data available before MODIS launch it was decided to limit our dataset to a single sensor to avoid potential biases between the sensors. Due to the frequent cloud coverage of the NW Atlantic it was decided to use 8-day composite images as daily images would not provide sufficient number of valid pixels. 

The values of chlorophyll-a pixels within St. Anns Bank polygon were extracted from each 8-day composite image and average chlorophyll-a concentration was computed for the polygon. The time series for the polygon and the associated climatology that was computed from time series data show characteristic spring blooms in March and April, with varying intensity and timing throughout the years (Figures~\ref{fig:modisChlaTS},~\ref{fig:ChlaSeasonal}). An example of MODIS semi-monthly chlorophyll-a products showing spring bloom progression in the St. Anns Bank area in 2012 is shown on Figure~\ref{fig:MapChlaBloomSpring}.

\paragraph{Primary Production}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Relevance:  productivity, habitat, biodiversity and species of interest (in relative order)
  \item Sampling:  MODIS, ...
  \item Spatial coverage: 39 N to 62.5 N and 42 W to 71 W, resolution of 1.5 km
  \item Temporal coverage: July 2002 to December 2014, 150 monthly  images

\end{itemize}

Marine primary production plays an important role in biogeochemical cycles, in food web dynamics, and in marine fisheries. It may be defined as the amount of organic material (or organic carbon) produced per unit area (or volume) per unit time by photosynthetic plants, predominately by phytoplankton.

Primary production of the ocean on synoptic scale is estimated by models that use satellite data (SST, ocean colour chlorophyll, and available light estimates at the surface), shipborne in-situ information on the vertical distribution of phytoplankton in the water column, and the phytoplankton\textquoteright s photosynthetic response to light.

Monthly primary production data were provided by the Remote Sensing Unit (RSU) at BIO that routinely generates production maps for the NW Atlantic as part of the Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program. The general approach for the production computation is described in Platt et al. (\cite{platt2008}) and employs chlorophyll and light estimates from MODIS, SST produced by the unit, and DFO's archive of shipborne measured parameters. This particular production algorithm has been validated with in-situ measured production (\cite{platt1988}) and also has performed very well in global comparisons \parencite{carr2006comparison}.

Primary production for each pixel within St. Anns Bank polygon was extracted from the monthly images and average production was computed for the polygon. The time series for the polygon and the associated monthly climatology are showing peaks in primary production in spring and summer with varying intensity and timing throughout the years (Figure~\ref{fig:ppTSmonthly} and Figure~\ref{fig:ppTSannual}).

\begin{itemize}
  \item Relevance:  productivity, habitat, biodiversity and species of interest (in relative order)
  \item Sampling:  AVHRR
  \item Spatial coverage: 39 N to 62.5 N and 42 W to 71 W, resolution of 1.5 km
  \item Temporal coverage: December 1997 to March 2015, 845 8-day composite images
  \item Source code: \url{https://bitbucket.org/ecomod/aegis/blob/master/inst/scripts/remoting.sensing.r}
\end{itemize}

Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from space was estimated using infrared channels of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board the polar-orbiting satellites.

The SST data for this study was provided by the Remote Sensing Unit from the BIO that has been downlinking AVHRR data from the National Oceanographic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites since 1997 on an L-band satellite receiver that resides on the roof of the BIO. The received data is routinely processed by the RSU and is supplemented by the data stream from the AVHRR onboard the European satellites. Composite SST images of different time periods are operationally produced as part of the Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program (RSU Technical Document 1). Here we used 8-day composite images with the same spatial coverage and spatial resolution as the ocean colour chlorophyll data.

The SST pixels within St. Anns Bank polygon were extracted from each 8-day composite image and average SST was computed for the polygon. The time series for the polygon and the associated climatology that was computed from time series data are shown on Figures~\ref{fig:SSTfromAVHRRmap} and \ref{fig:SSTfromAVHRRts}. An example of semi-monthly SST products corresponding to the spring bloom progression in the St. Anns Bank area in 2012 is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SstSeasonal}.

\subsubsection{Groundfish survey}
\label{sec:groundfishSurvey}

The Groundfish survey (Figure~\ref{fig:trawlLocationsMap}) utilizes a Western II-A Otter Trawl net with a wingspread that is \textbf{assumed} to be 12.5 m and a target distance of 1.75 nautical miles (3.24 km) and/or a 20-30min tow. This net was used from 1982 to the present. Prior to this period, a Yankee 36 ft trawl was used with unmeasured net configuration data. It operates night and day. Sampling occurrence as a function of time and season are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:trawlLocationsMap}. The consistent identification of invertebrates in this survey began in approximately the year 2000. All species assemblage analyses will use data from the post 2000 period.

\paragraph{Net mensuration} 

Sensors measuring trawl net configuration and state are ubiquitous in modern surveys and commercial fishing practices. In the snow crab survey, net configuration has been monitored and used to determine swept area manually (since 1996) and also with an automated procedure (since 2004). Unfortunately, in the groundfish survey, this information is ignored, even though the survey series is a major source of information for many stock assessments. Net configuration data have been collected in the groundfish surveys sporadically since 2004 (Figure~\ref{fig:groundfishNoSets}). However, swept area estimates have never been directly computed. Instead, the catch data is used almost invariably with the assumption that each tow is equivalent in swept area (a "standard tow"). Alternatively, it has also been used by some assessments by "adjusting" catch data by the linear distance from "start" and "end" times and locations and so implicitly assuming the net configuration to be a constant (Don Clarke, personal communication). Both approaches are problematic for the reasons identified below. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{/home/jae/bio.data/aegis/mpa/sab/numberOfSets.pdf}
  \caption{Number of sets in the Groundfish surveys and the number of sets with usable net configuration data.}
  \label{fig:groundfishNoSets}
\end{figure}

To address these important and incorrect assumptions, algorithms were developed to automatically determine lift off and touch down times, locations and net width \parencite{Munden:2017nets}. Based upon random visual inspection, the skill was determined to be reasonable, with $>90\%$ of the cases having estimates within 15 seconds of visual determination of touch down/lift off locations. Where bias was observed this was mostly to underestimate total contact time due to an over-smoothing of the lift off or touch down profiles.

From this re-analysis, the actual time and distance of bottom contact was found to range from approximately 10 to 40 minutes and distances from 1.75 to 6 km, bringing into question many historical studies that assumed a "standard tow" of 3.24 km in length. Even when compared to the "length" of a tow, determined from positions recorded of "start" and "stop" times or locations were frequently in error relative to actual locations of net touch down and lift-off determined from GPS information (Figure~\ref{fig:groundfishTowDistance}, \textcite{Munden:2017nets}). 


\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{/home/jae/bio.data/aegis/mpa/sab/toweddistance.pdf}
  \caption{Towed distance comparisons in the groundfish survey.}
  \label{fig:groundfishTowDistance}
\end{figure}

Net structure also varies along tows and between tows as it encounters differing substrate, bathymetric and hydrodynamic conditions and vessel speeds, currents, surface sea state, net fullness/filtration efficiency due to contact with rocks/boulders/mud \parencite{Munden:2017nets}. Assuming net width to be a constant at 12.5~m is, therefore, problematic (Figures~\ref{fig:groundfishWingDoorAnnual}, \ref{fig:groundfishWingDoorComparison}).

\end{figure}

Right: Surface area estimates based on GSINF logged start-end positions vs computed surface area estimated from tow track and net configuration \textbf{as well as modeled solutions}.}
  \label{fig:groundfishSweptArea}
\end{figure}

When the variable nature of the length and width of survey tracks are both accounted, the potential error in swept area estimates are evidently large Figure~(\ref{fig:groundfishSweptArea}). Indeed, the range in variation of swept area was approximately the same in magnitude as the swept area of a standard tow! This means that an unnecessary and large "observation error", potentially as large in magnitude as the magnitude of the catch in a set, may be needlessly introduced to survey indices. Further, swept area estimates based upon standard tows were also biased down relative to estimates based upon net mensuration and actual tow tracks, meaning that there in a high probability of over-estimating catch densities.  

Unfortunately, net mensuration data is still not consistently recorded nor used in the groundfish surveys (Figure~\ref{fig:groundfishNoSets}). As a result, it is not possible to satisfactorily estimate swept area for all historical sets. Statistical methods of recalibration were used to impute swept area in these latter sets (Figure~\ref{fig:groundfishSweptArea}), using GAM-based estimates based on relationships with location, depth and salinity ($R^2$ ranged from 40 to 60\%, depending upon availability of covariates). However, due to issues with a significant bias detected in wingspread sensors since 2013 (Figure~\ref{fig:groundfishWingDoorComparison}), this approach cannot be extended for the period post-2013. 

To conclude this section, the observation error (uncertainty) associated with this data series, used in so many research programs, is needlessly high and biased high. Removal of these errors by a coherent representation of net configuration is simple to address and a major data gap that needs to be fixed , \parencite{Munden:2017nets}.

\subsubsection{Snow crab survey}
\label{(se:snowcrab)}

The snow crab survey uses a \textit{Bigouden Nephrops} trawl (Figure~\ref{fig:trawlLocationsMap}), a net originally designed to dig into soft sediments for the capture of lobsters in Europe (headline of 20~m, 27.3~m foot rope mounted with a 3.2~m long 8~mm chain, with a mesh size of 80~mm in the wings and 60~mm in the belly and 40~mm in the cod-end). Tows were conducted for $\sim$~5~minutes in duration with duration of bottom contact being monitored by Netmind and Seabird sensors. The width of the mouth of the net was also monitored with Netmind sensors. The ship speed was maintained at $\sim 2$~knots. The warp length was $\sim 3 \times$ the depth. Positional information as well as water temperature measurements were collected using a global positioning system and Minilog and Seabird data recorders. The surface area swept by the net was calculated from swept distance and net width information.

\paragraph{Supplemental SAB stations}

The 2015 snow crab trawl survey increased sampling in the St. Anns Bank area to provide additional information about the marine macro-fauna. Fourteen stations in, and adjacent to the proposed MPA location were included in this additional sampling. These locations were close to previous snow crab survey stations and represent varied depths and bottom-types and habitats. The species composition of the catch at these stations varied greatly as expected with differences in depth and bottom type. The sampling at these stations included:

\begin{itemize}
  \item all catch identified to species level
  \item all species counted and weighed to tenth of a kilogram
  \item all finfish and crab species measured and weighed individually
  \item stomach samples taken from fin-fish for diet studies.
\end{itemize}

An overview (in Google Earth format) of the the latest catch and sampling at these stations can be found at: \url{http://www.enssnowcrab.com/mpa/mpatows.kmz}


\subsection{Fisheries activity}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Relevance:  productivity, habitat, biodiversity and species of interest
	\item Sampling:  MARFIS and ZIFF
	\item Spatial coverage: full extent 
	\item Temporal coverage: 1999 - present
	\item Source code: \url{https://bitbucket.org/ecomod/aegis/blob/master/R/marfissci*}
\end{itemize}	


Commercial-fishing activities can modify the habitat and ecosystem and contribute to changes in the structure and functioning of exploited marine communities.  Fishing impacts can be direct, such as the reduction of targeted and non-targeted species, as well as truncations in age and size distributions.  Other direct effects due to fishing activities include habitat alterations and substrate modifications through interactions with fishing gear. Fishing can also cause indirect impacts via changes in foodweb structure within an ecosystem.  

Direct impacts of commercial fishing can be measured using data form the Marine Fish (MARFIS) database that provides information on commercial-fishing activities.  For most fisheries the fishing position, gear type, catch per unit effort, estimated weight of catch by species information is available from the database. The MARFIS database details information for all fishing trips, where a landing is reported within the DFO Maritimes region and includes data from 2002 through 2015. The exploitation of marine species and entanglement threat to cetaceans and sea turtles will be quantified from data derived from the MARFIS database.

Trawling and dredging disturbances to the sea floor will require different estimation techniques.  Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) point locations have been used to estimate fishing-effort distributions \parencites[e.g., ][]{lee2010developing} and to estimate impacts on the seabed \parencite{gerritsen2013much}.  Similar techniques can be developed within R to estimated the impacts to benthos from trawling and dredging activities within the St. Anns Bank area. 

St. Anns Bank Area of Interest has four zones within it with various levels of fishing restrictions (Figure \ref{fig:SABCloseup}). Commercial fishing is restricted in Zone 1, the largest area, with the exception of the seal harvest. The MPA requires monitoring to ensure that fishers are complying with these regulations. Monitoring could be done through a variety of techniques and data sources, including data reported in the MARFIS database, Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data that allow the direct monitoring of fishing activities. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data may also be used to monitoring fishing activities if the vessel is large enough to require AIS ($\geq$ 300 gross registered tonnes) or if a fishing vessel has voluntarily installed an AIS system onboard.  


\subsubsection{MARFIS data extraction}

Prorated landings for all species from 2002 onwards were extracted from MARFIS. The proration process distributes the actual reported weights across the reported efforts as identified within the fishers\textquoteright logs.  

In addition to the landings, we also included several other forms of catch so as to better reflect the removal of biomass. These catches were identified by their \textquotedblleft CATCH \textunderscore USAGE\textunderscore CODE\textquotedblright, and include biomass used as bait or discarded (sometimes identified as dead).  Live discards were not included.  These catches were self-reported in a variety of units, so they have been converted to kg as necessary to match the logged landings. 

Most log records included the spatial location of the catch, and some catches have multiple sets of coordinates available within the table MARFISSCI. LOG\textunderscore EFRT\textunderscore STD\textunderscore INFO\textunderscore ID.  ENT\textunderscore LATITUDE and ENT\textunderscore LONGITUDE are physically entered into the logbook by the fisher, and were used preferentially over DET\textunderscore LATITUDE  and DET\textunderscore LONGITUDE, which are determined from other sources (like Loran-C).  

Many logs have no usable coordinates \textendash  either they are left blank, or they are clearly incorrect (i.e. on land).  Rather than discarding this data, we still extracted it, and attempted to account for this biomass in the next section.

The extraction logic is captured in: \\
\url{https://bitbucket.org/ecomod/aegis/blob/master/R/marfissci.get.data.R}.

The script above allows the user to specify one or more species and on or more years, and the data will be extracted and saved in a local file.  This file serves as the input to the next step \textendash Data Layer Aggregation.

%identified all \textquotedblleft un-positionable\textquotedblright  data and re-distributed the total weight over the whole spatial area in proportion to the known locations of catches (for each species/year combination).  For example, if 40\% of the catch for a species in a given year was identified as coming from grid cell \textquotedblleft x\textquotedblright, than 40\% of the \textquotedblleft un-positionable\textquotedblright catch would be added to that cell. 


%In consultation with Commercial Data Division staff (Robert Grandy, Greg Croft and Krista Wry), prorated landings for all species from 2002 onwards were extracted from MARFIS. The proration process distributes the actual reported weights across the reported efforts as identified within the fishers' logs.

%Most logs include coordinates describing the location of the catch, but it is not uncommon to also find those that don't.  Coordinates were used preferentially in the following order:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item LOG\_EFRT\_STD\_INFO\_ID.ENT\_
%  \item LOG\_EFRT\_STD\_INFO\_ID.DET\_
%  \item Centroid of the determined (NAFO) Fishing Area
%\end{itemize}

%Those catches that did not have associated coordinates were identified so that significant catches would not be accidentally overlooked. Catches without associated coordinates or those falling on land will be spread over the whole spatial area of the species, with weights distributed in proportion to known catch locations for a given year.

%In addition to the landings, we have also included several other forms of catch so as to better reflect the removal of biomass. These catches include those used as bait or discarded (including live, dead and unspecified). The position logic was the same as that used above. Additionally, these catches are self-reported in a variety of units, so they are converted to kg as necessary to match the logged landings The catch consisting of "live discards" will not be included in the final report.

%The extraction logic is captured in the script found at: \url{https://bitbucket.org/ecomod/aegis/blob/master/R/get.marfis.data.R}

\subsubsection{MARFIS data quality control and aggregation}
Once data was extracted, it was processed through a second script, \textquotedblleft marfissci.process.data.r\textquotedblright.  This script serves to QC and aggregate the data, as well as apply un-positionable catches of a species proportionally to the positioned data.

QC occurs in 2 stages, and is quite simple.  First, all records without coordinates are identified and retained, but removed from the main dataset.  Next, all remaining data is compared against a high resolution coastline (the same as is shown in Figure \ref{fig:SAB}), and those points falling on land are identified and retained, but removed from the main dataset.

The remaining data are considered good, and these data is then aggregated.  The aggregation level is user-defined, but will likely be a scale of 3 minutes since it is an even division of a degree, with no potential for rounding errors (i.e. 3' = 1/60*3 = 0.05 vs 2' = 0.03).  The aggregation process outputs a single record with a single position for all of the catch in the area.

Following aggregation, the proportion of the total catch attributable to each cell is calculated.  The data that failed the QC tests are then summed into a single value, representing the total catch that can\textquoteright t be positioned.  These data are then added to all of the cells in the same proportion as was calculated in the previous step.

For example, one cell might have a total catch of 3269.7 kg, and this cell represents 0.002167 of the total catch.  If there are 5954.1 kgs of un-positioned data, then the \textquotedblleft corrected\textquotedblright value for the weight attributed to this cell would be calculated as:
3269.7 kg + (55954.1 kg * 0.002167) = 3390.9 kg.

\subsection{Vessel activity}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Relevance:  habitat, biodiversity and species of interest
	\item Sampling:  AIS
	\item Spatial coverage: Global for satellite AIS, coastal ($\sim$ 100km) for Canadian Coast Guard terrestrial AIS network.
	\item Temporal coverage: 2013 - present
	\item Source code: https://bitbucket.org/ecomod/aegis/blob/master/inst/scripts/ais.r
\end{itemize}	


Commercial shipping can have various direct and indirect effects on an ecosystem. Direct effects including the contamination of the ecosystem from the discharge of contaminates, radiated underwater noise, the introduction of aquatic invasive species, and vessel-strike risk to marine mammals and sea turtles. Spatia-temporal data on vessel traffic is needed to determine the probability and/or magnitude of these effects on ecosystems. Such information is available through AIS data.  

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) requires AIS transponders on all international vessels $\geq$ 300 gross tonnage and all passenger vessels.  Many studies have used AIS data to examine risk of lethal vessel collisions to large whales \parencite[e.g.,][ ]{vanderlaan:2009:efficacy, wiley:2011:modeling, redfern2013assessing, guzman2013potential} or to assess and monitor ship noise and assess the impact on marine mammals \parencite{ hatch2008characterizing, mckenna2012underwater, hatch2012quantifying, merchant2014monitoring}. Similar exercises can be undertaken in the St Anns Bank area with AIS data.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada has access to two different sources of AIS data.  The first is from the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) terrestrial system that was developed to track and monitoring coastal shipping and provides a real-time, continuous stream of AIS vessel positions.  Archived historical data from this system is available for January 2012 through December 2015 and data from 2016 is currently streaming and archiving to a server within DFO. Decoding routines have been developed using native R methods for these data.   Both sources of data provide dynamic and static data, where the dynamic data includes information on vessel identity, speed, and location, and static data includes information vessel identity, name, size, and type.   

The CCG terrestrial system as 21 AIS coastal receiving stations in in the Maritime region and 19 AIS coastal receiving stations in Newfoundland and Labrador.  These receiving stations have limited range for detecting vessels (Figure~\ref{fig:TAIS}) as AIS transmission detectability are primarily a function of the receiving tower height above sea level and the height of the AIS antenna on the transmitting vessel. AIS data is transmitted via Very High Frequency (VHF) marine radio on two channels (161.9765 and 162.025 MHz). Based on the height of the associated towers and a vessel with an AIS antenna 100 m high, line of sight calculations for VHF provide a reception range of  57 to 113 m in and around St. Anns Bank (Figure~\ref{fig:LOF}). However there are several other factors that will contribute to transmission range including weather conditions. \textcite{Simard2014shipping} estimated that coastal antennas within this network generally provide a reception range of ~100 km (Figure~\ref{fig:DetAIS}).  In either case the terrestrial network is insufficient to monitor vessels across the entire AOI and just north of the AOI. These data can be combined with satellite AIS data.

\end{figure}


The satellite AIS data are available globally for the years 2013, 2014, and 2015 with on-going data collection for 2016. Although satellite AIS data coverage if global, data are limited temporally as large sections of vessel transits are unavailable due (see Figure~\ref{fig:astar})to a limited number of satellites (n = 8) and their orbital paths.  Spatial interpolation must be completed to \textquotedblleft fill in\textquotedblright  missing data.  Spatial interpolation is achieved using an A$^{\star}$ function \parencite{hart1968formal} that estimates the minimum cost to get from one point to another based on a cost map.  The coast map was estimated from seasonally aggregated annual density distributions of satellite AIS data for the years 2013 through 2015 (Figure~\ref{fig:costmvap}).  Grid resolution for this analysis was inially set to 0.01 degrees and within each grid square the number of unique vessels, identified by the vessel's Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number was counted daily and summed through time.  Cost maps were estimated quarterly.  Two different cost maps were developed for the St. Anns Bank area to interpolate vessel transits north of Cape Breton into and out of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  Interpolation was heavily influenced by the ferries transiting between Cape Breton and Newfoundland, and therefore a cost map was developed without the data derived from these ferries.  A bathymetric restriction can also be build into the cost maps.

\subsection{Data gaps}

\subsubsection{Feeding relationships -- Stomach Database}

Bottom trawl surveys (see Section \ref{sec:groundfishSurvey}) have been conducted by DFO on the Scotian Shelf annual since 1970 using a stratified random design.  Sampling protocols changed in the late 1990s with the focus changing from commercially important finfish species to more comprehensive ecosystem monitoring that included the sampling of macroinvertebrates \parencite{tremblay2007distribution}.  Stomach contents samples were collected from finfish using a length-stratified sampling protocol.  Prey were quantified by weight and number, and often identified to the genus or family level, or to the species level when possible.  

For the purpose of determining any change in the diet of finfish pre- and post- implementation of the MPA on St. Anns Bank or if there were differences within the MPA compared to other areas on the Scotian shelf, we explored the stomach database to determine if these dietary differences could be described and detected. Within the database, 54\% of the prey number observations were missing.  Due to the large interannual variation in prey weights estimating the prey number consistently from non-missing data where both the prey number and weight was available was determined to be impracticable and unreliable.  Due to the sampling stratification both by depth and length classes it was further determined that there would be insufficient samples available to reach the asymptote of prey species accumulation curves \parencite{cook2010food} and total diet composition could not be detected.  Prey species identified in the stomach samples could be used for quantifying biodiversity and species richness \parencite{cook2012use} for the proposed MPA and comparing it to similar ecosystem or pre- and post-implementation.

\subsubsection{Other ecosystem metrics}
On the side of ecosystem characterization, data gaps in the following are evident: pelagic fish (small and large bodied) and invertebrates (e.g., squid, jellyfish), substrate characterisation via multibeam surveys, marine mammals, reptiles, birds and genetic diversity. They are gaps in that they are expensive and/or difficult to monitor and/or with information that is not readily available at present.

\subsubsection{Other human usage metrics}
A large number of variables and ecosystem descriptors are of course being ignored. In particular are human influences such as seismic activity, pollution, ballast water, etc. They may be addressed once the basic biological features have been fully addressed.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

All methods have been implemented in R, an open-sourced programming environment. The methods are shared via http://bitbucket.org using the \textbf{git} revisioning system. These architectural choices were adopted to enhance the transparency and ease of sharing and collaborating with all interested parties. It is structured such that any additional data series can be easily added to the system to permit adaptive change. In this way, the approaches developed represents a true \textbf{structural framework} in which to further develop methods and approaches. 

The main methods used/developed in this report will be described in this section.


\subsection{Biodiversity and taxonomic richness}


Biodiversity is seemingly a simple concept that is, in fact, fundamentally complex. This is because it ranges in focus from genetic and phenotypic variations within a local population, breeding populations to biome or even larger scaled genetic and phylogentic and community variability, both in terms of their number and relative dominance. Any and all of these aspects of biodiversity can be estimated. However, it is the number of unique kinds of organisms found in a given location (commonly called taxonomic richness) that is most readily quantified and monitored. 

Taxonomic richness is known to increase asymptotically with sampling intensity. As such, a statistical correction ("rarefaction") for spatial and temporal sampling intensity must be applied to be meaningfully comparable across locations and time. Specifically, the model was a simple regression model:


\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:biodiversity}
  R \sim \text{Lognormal} ( (\beta + \alpha_s \log(\text{SA}) + \alpha_t \log(\text{TS}) ),  \tau ) 
\end{equation}


and used to predict an expected richness $R$ at a standard surface area and time depth. The other terms are $\beta$ a constant, $SA$ surface area (ranging from 1 to 50 km, radial length scale), $TS$, the number of years entering into the count (ranging from 0 to 5 years) and $\tau$ is a lognormal error. The autocorrelation in SA and TS are ignored for the present but will eventually be modeled as well via a poisson process.  

The intent is to model the spatial/temporal patterns (Sections~\ref{sec:interpolationTS}, ~\ref{sec:interpolationSpatial}) and then integrate them in a risk-based approach (Section~\ref{sec:riskapproach}) to permit formal statements of risk and probability of exceeding thresholds. 


\subsection{Productivity}

Total system standing biomass is generally used as a proxy for productivity. They are not the same, however, they will be used to describe aggregate abundance of: various categories of organisms such as total bottom biomass, macroinvertebrates, zoopankton, phytoplanton, chlorophyll-a, etc. 

To estimate true production, a modeled approach is necessary. These indices can then be coupled with spatially explicit total landings to estimate the biomass and secondary production associated with the biota and fishery exploitation/footprint. 

The intent is, therefore, to model the spatial/temporal patterns (Sections~\ref{sec:interpolationTS}, ~\ref{sec:interpolationSpatial}) and then integrate them in a risk-based approach (Section~\ref{sec:riskapproach}) to permit formal statements of risk and probability of exceeding thresholds and perhaps even estimate net production. 


\subsection{Habitat}

The basic Hutchinsonian notion of "ecological niche" is closely tied to our current understanding of "habitat". It is a multi-dimensional concept in that it incorporates an undefined set of  environmental variables and the associated biological constraints/specialisations/requirements (e.g., nutrients, thermal, oxygen, pH, etc.) pertinent to an organism of interest. 

Two notions of habitat can be discriminated, depending upon outlook: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Functional ($H_f$) -- make increasing more precise habitat definitions by adding more environmental and biological factors for increasingly more precise categories of organisms   
  \item Integrative ($H_i$) -- the biota living in a given time and location represent a full integration of all relevant environmental and biological factors at their proper space time scales and so in effect characterises the full system-level concept of "habitat space" 
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Functional-habitat modeling}
\label{sec:habitatSpecies}

A utilitarian way of describing \textbf{Functional-habitat} space of an organism is to examine the presence-absence or relative abundance of organisms as a function of environmental gradients and biological/life history constraints. From such information, the likelihood of a given location to be potential habitat for an organism of interest can be derived. The simplest method is to develop a probability model under the assumption that the presence or absence of an organism is a Bernoulli process. This can be readily parameterised using standard Generalized Linear Models. However, as environmental constraints are almost always modal in influence given a wide enough environmental gradient, a nonlinear model is more useful. Generalized Additive Models and Autoregressive Models are two methods that can deal with these environmental constraints in a simple and efficient manner \parencite{choi:2010}.  

The utility of such an approach is most relevant for organisms with highly specific habitat requirements. They are used in this framework. The intent is to develop such Functional habitat models for key species of interest: wolffish, cod, etc., to assess changes in their available "habitat". Examples are provided from the snow crab assessment in Figures (\ref{fig:snowcrabHabitat}, \ref{fig:snowcrabHabitatTS}). Though this Functional-habitat concept itself does not exclude species interactions, in actual practice, they are generally ignored as they make the statistical estimation impossibly over-parameterized (but see \cite{choi:2012:resdoc} for one possible solution). Further, as there will always be factors that are either poorly known, poorly sampled, or poorly parameterized (e.g., dissolved oxygen, pH, redox, bacteria, jellyfish, squid, pollution, substrate type, etc.), these models will always necessarily be incomplete. 

It is possible to model the spatial/temporal patterns (Sections~\ref{sec:interpolationTS}, ~\ref{sec:interpolationSpatial}) and then "integrate" them in a risk-based approach (Section~\ref{sec:riskapproach}) to permit more formal statements of risk and probability of exceeding thresholds. 



\subsubsection{Integral habitat -- whole system level}
\label{sec:integralHabitat}

While the Functional habitat concept is interesting and pragmatic, it is decidedly a reductionistic perspective. The monitoring and assessment requirements for an MPA also demands a whole system perspective. The \textit{assumption} we make is that \textbf{the relative abundance of organisms found in a given location and time defines and mirrors the kind of habitat in which they live}. Sessile organisms that require high flow environments and associated biota tend to exist and flourish with a given group of other organisms similarly adapted; and they are different from those that require cold waters and minimal water flow, etc. 

Thus, if we can quantify the observed species composition in a given location and time, we would, in effect, be describing the habitat. We will define this as \textbf{Integral-habitat} ($H_i$): species assemblage information that directly reflects all biological and environmental interactions simultaneously, both measured and unmeasured and some too fleeting to be measurable. 

Fortunately, these associations are readily quantified using a standard multivariate methods of data ordination. Here we focus upon, Principal Components Analysis which focuses upon an eigenanalysis of correlational structure of the species assemblages and Correspondence Analysis which focuses upon an eigenanalysis of Chi-squared differences.  

The intent is to model the spatial/temporal patterns (Sections~\ref{sec:interpolationTS}, ~\ref{sec:interpolationSpatial}) and then integrate them in a risk-based approach (Section~\ref{sec:riskapproach}) to permit formal statements of risk and probability of exceeding thresholds. 



\subsection{Connectivity: space and time scales}
\label{sec:connectivity}

\subsubsection{Spatial scale}
\label{sec:interpolationSpatial}

MPAs exist in a spatial context. The characteristic spatial scale of productivity, diversity and habitat found in the MPA will determine which processes will be relevant to these aspects of an MPA. If the spatial variations in the productivity of a species of interest is small relative to the size of an MPA, the chances of the MPA having an influence upon the species is enhanced. This is usually the case when short-range processes dominate (e.g., less mobile species, weakly dispersing, low currents, habitat heterogeneity at small scales). If, however, the spatial scale is larger than the MPA, then it would mean that broader/larger processes were influencing the productivity of the species (e.g., higher mobility or dispersal processes/current, and stronger spatial connectivity, habitat heterogeneity at larger scales) -- resulting in a lower likelihood of the MPA having an influence upon the species or components of interest. 

A second important factor is the relationship of the characteristic spatial scale to monitoring. As organisms exist at a given spatial scale in a given area, a sampling/monitoring protocol must reference/address these spatial scales. For example, when a spatial feature (e.g., biodiversity) demonstrates short characteristic spatial scales (i.e., a lot of spatial structure at smaller scales), any sampling approach must respect this and similarly operate at such shorter scales or even smaller if one is to be able to resolve the patterns and describe properly the subject of interest. Similarly, if a feature (e.g., biodiversity) is long-ranged and one wishes to resolve the patterns properly, then a sampling protocol must be similarly long-ranged to resolve the pattern. A sampling program much smaller than the characteristic spatial scale would be beneficial, but the accrued benefits relative to cost of sampling would be rapidly diminishing, in that time, effort and resources requirements generally increase more rapidly than any benefit (e.g., in the simplest case, if one is looking only naively at standard error as a measure of benefit, then it would increase asymptotically with increased effort with a power of $-1/2$). 

For these fundamental reasons, defining the spatial scale of a given observation or process is imperative for the development of any assessment or monitoring of MPAs. To this end, we represent any spatially explicit observation as $Y(\bm{s})$, which are measured in a coordinate space $\{ \bm{s} \in S \in \Re^d \}$ and domain $S$ of dimensionality $d$. In this framework, we will mainly focus upon the case of $d=2$ spatial dimensions (e.g., longitude and latitude or northing and easting). The observations $Y(\bm{s})$ are assumed to be realizations of a \textbf{spatial stochastic process}, $y$, that is, some latent, unobservable but real stochastic generative function. The manner in which the variability of $y$ changes as a function of distance $h=\| \bm{s} - \bm{s}' \|$, is known as the spatial autocorrelation function or in a slightly different form as a (semi-) variogram. This spatial dependence is highly informative in that it defines how similarity changes with distance and so ultimately defines \textbf{spatial scale}. 

The spatial model is succinctly expressed as a regression model of a stochastic process (\cite{banerjee2014hierarchical}):

\begin{equation}
Y(\bm{s}) = \mu(\bm{s}) + e(\bm{s})
\label{eq:spatialModel}
\end{equation}

where, the observations $Y(\bm{s})$ are a function of some mean process $\mu(\bm{s})$, and a residual error process $e(\bm{s})$. The latter are further defined as:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \mu(\bm{s}) &=& x(\bm{s})^{T} \beta \\
  e(\bm{s})  &=& \omega(\bm{s}) + \varepsilon(\bm{s})
\end{eqnarray*}

where $x(\bm{s})$ are spatially referenced predictors with associated parameters $\beta$;  and the residual error process is decomposed into spatial $\omega(\bm{s})$ and nonspatial  $\varepsilon(\bm{s})$ components. The latter is also known as "nugget" error in geostatistics and represents error associated with measurement and/or microscale variability/processes.

The error structures are usually assumed to be the following:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \varepsilon(\bm{s})  &\sim& \textrm{N}(0, \tau^2) \\
  \omega(\bm{s}) &\sim& \textrm{GP}(0, C(\bm{s},\bm{s}'; \bm{\theta}))  \\
  \bm{Y} &\sim& \textrm{MVN}( \bm{\mu}, \bm{\Sigma}). 
\end{eqnarray*}

The nonspatial error is assumed normal with mean 0 and standard deviation $\tau$. The spatial error is assumed to follow a Gaussian Process with mean 0 and covariance $C(\bm{s},\bm{s}'; \bm{\theta})$, that is, a \textit{spatial covariance function} with parameters $\bm{\theta}$. A multivariate normal likelihood is usually assumed for the observations $\bm{Y} = (Y(\bm{s}_1), \dots, Y(\bm{s}_n) )^T$, with mean $\bm{\mu} = \bm{X} \bm{\beta}$ and covariance $\bm{\Sigma} = \left[ C(\bm{s}_i, \bm{s}_j; \theta) \right]^{n}_{i,j=1}+ \tau^2 I_n$. $\bm{X} = \left[ \bm{x}(\bm{s}_i)^T \right]^{n}_{i=1}$ is the matrix of regressors and $I_n$ is an identity matrix of size $n$. 


The spatial covariance function $C(h) = C(\bm{s}, \bm{s}')$ expresses the tendency of observations closer together to be more similar to each other than those further away; $h=\| \bm{s} - \bm{s}' \|$ is the distance separating observations. Historically, a number of different forms have been used. The most frequently used forms include (for $h>0$):

\begin{eqnarray*}
  C(h)_{\textrm{Spherical}} &=& 
    \begin{cases}    
      \sigma^2( 1 - \frac{3}{2} h/\phi + \frac{1}{2}(h/\phi)^3 )  ; &   0 < h <= \phi \\
      0  ; &  h > \phi 
    \end{cases}  \\
  C(h)_{\text{Exponential}} &=& \sigma^2 ( \exp(-h/\phi) )   \\
  C(h)_{\text{Gaussian}} &=& \sigma^2 ( \exp(-(h/\phi)^2) ) \\
  C(h)_{\text{Powered exponential}} &=& \sigma^2 ( \exp(-| h/\phi | ^p) ) \\
  C(h)_{\text{Mat\'{e}rn}} &=& \sigma^2 \frac{1}{2^{\nu-1}\Gamma(\nu) } ( \sqrt{2\nu} h/\phi )^\nu \ K_{\nu} ( \sqrt{2\nu} h/\phi  )  .
\end{eqnarray*}


At zero distance, $C(0) = Cov( Y(s), Y(s)) = Var(Y(s)) = \tau^2 + \sigma^2$ (\textit{i.e.}, global variance), where $\tau$ is the nonspatial error, $\sigma$ is the spatial error, and $\theta=\{\phi, \nu, p, \dots \}$ are  function-specific parameters including $\phi$ the \textit{range} parameter. $\Gamma(\cdotp)$ is the Gamma function and $K_{\nu}(\cdotp)$ is the Bessel function of the second kind with smoothness $\nu$. The latter, Mat\'{e}rn covariance function is particularly appealing and more frequently used as the shape of this function is more flexible (Figure \ref{fig:matern_acf}), albeit at the cost of an additional parameter (Appendix \ref{sec:matern}).

At $nu=100$, it approaches the Gaussian curve (upper dark curve on the left side) while at $\nu=0.5$ the curve is exponential (lower dark curve on the left side). The associated semi-variograms (scaled to unit variance) $\gamma(h)$ are shown in light stippled lines. Spatial scale is defined, in this framework, as the distance $h$ at which the autocorrelation falls to 0.05\% (dashed horizontal line)-- in this example between 2.5 and 3 units, depending upon value of $\nu$.}

The semivariance, more commonly used in geostatistics, is the covariance reflected on the horizontal axis of the global variance: $\gamma(h)=C(0)-C(h) = \frac{1}{2} \ \textrm{Var} [ Y(\bm{s}) - Y(\bm{s}')]$. 

The \textbf{spatial autocorrelation function} is defined as the covariance function scaled by the global variance: $\rho(h)=C(h)/C(0)$. For the purposes of this framework, we will define the \textbf{spatial scale} to be the distance at which the spatial autocorrelation decreases asymptotically to $\rho(x) \rightarrow 0.05$ ("practical" range). This will be determined in modeled form where possible (Equation \ref{eq:spatialModel}). Where it is not possible, an empirical estimate will be made derived from the empirical semivariogram. We focus upon spatial patterns larger than 1 km in resolution and smaller than the size of study domain, the "Scotian Shelf Ecosystem" (SSE). 


\subsubsection{Temporal scale}
\label{sec:interpolationTS}

MPAs also exist in a dynamic frame. As such, similar to the above spatial considerations, there also exists some characteristic temporal scale upon which an MPA and its subcomponents operate. If the overall temporal variations of the biota and environment is small relative to the overall life of an MPA, the chances of the MPA having an influence upon the species is enhanced. Presumably, the longevity of MPAs will be long lasting, and so will guarantee some influence, however small that may be; an effect that would be enhanced if the subject is shorter-ranged in spatial scales.

Again, similar to the spatial scale case, this also has a simple and obvious implication in terms of monitoring and assessment. Short-range variations require higher sampling effort to resolve/understand the issues and vice-versa.

As the temporal scale is an informative metric for monitoring and assessment of an MPA, we must be precise in its definition. Similar to the spatial case, we focus upon how the correlation and variability of some quantity changes with greater difference in time. The analogue to the semivariogram in a timeseries context is known as a \textbf{cumulative periodogram}. 

A periodogram expresses the amount of variance found at different wavelengths ($\omega$). It is a discrete sample estimate of the continuous concept of spectral density $\gamma(t)$: 

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:spectraldDensity}
  \gamma(t) = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{2\pi i \omega t} f(\omega) d \omega.
\end{equation}


It is easily obtained from a Fast Fourier Transform of any arbitrary time-series and so the cumulative distribution permits a rapid identification of the time scale at which correlation drops to some arbitrary level. To be approximately comparable to the spatial scale, we define the temporal scale as the time difference by which the Cumulative Power Spectral Density increases to 95\% of the total variance.

If the goal is to resolve short-term processes then sampling must also, of necessity be more frequent. However, similar to spatial scale issues, there is a point where there will be diminishing returns for any increase in the resolution of a temporal signal. It is the intent of this framework to operate upon timescale of 1 yr or greater. Sub-annual signals where they are available would be used to decompose the seasonal signals from the inter-annual signals to avoid bias due to discretization errors. 

\subsubsection{Space-time models}
\label{sec:spacetime}
In reality, spatial and temporal patterns coexist and evolve. They are correlated processes and as such a challenge to model properly ("nonseparable" -- see below). This renders the independent treatment and estimation of autocorrelation in time and space problematic. Nonetheless, new developments in computational methods are bringing such models within range of use for a framework such as this. This is primarily due to efficient methods associated with numerical modeling of Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs), especially in spectral (Fourier) space. 

Again, we follow \textcite{banerjee2014hierarchical}'s development of spatio-temporal models as a simple extension of the spatial regression model (Equation \ref{eq:spatialModel}). The observations, $Y(\bm{s},t)$ are measured in a coordinate space $(\bm{s},t) \in S \in \Re^d \times \Re $ in the domain $S$ of dimensionality $d +1$. The space-time regression model can then be specified as:  

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:spacetimeModel}
  Y(\bm{s},t) = \mu(\bm{s},t) + e(\bm{s},t) , 
\end{equation}

where, $\mu(\bm{s},t) = x(\bm{s},t)^{T} \beta(\bm{s},t)$ is the mean process and $e(\bm{s},t)$ the residual error. The parameters $\beta$ of the spatially referenced predictors $x$ can have variable forms: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\beta(\bm{s},t)$ -- varying in both time and space
  \item $\beta(\bm{s})$ -- spatially varying (fixed in time) 
  \item $\beta(t)$ -- temporally varying (and fixed in space)
  \item $\beta$ -- completely fixed (no variation in time and space)
  \item $\beta_{s}(\bm{s}) + \beta_{t}(t)$ -- complex, hierarchical (mixed).
\end{itemize}


The error process can be separated into a spatiotemporally structured component $\omega$ and an unstructured component $\varepsilon$s:

\[ e(\bm{s},t) = \omega(\bm{s},t) +  \varepsilon(\bm{s},t) .\] 

The \textit{unstructured} error is usually assumed to be a white error process: $\varepsilon(\bm{s},t) \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\varepsilon)$. However, the manner in which the   \textit{spatiotemporally structured} error is handled is not straight-forward:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\omega_s(t)$ -- temporal effects nested in sites (temporal evolution at each site, space is not modelled)
  \item $\omega_t(\bm{s})$ -- spatial effects nested in time (spatial evolution at each time, time is not modelled)
  \item $\omega(\bm{s})  \upsilon(t)$ or $\omega(\bm{s}) + \upsilon(t)$ -- \textit{separable} (structure in space and structure in time are independent)
  \item $\omega(\bm{s},t)$ -- non-separable (both time and space structure evolve in a nonsimple manner).
\end{itemize}

If spatial and temporal autocorrelation act independently ("separable") then: \\
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \upsilon(t) &\sim& \text{GP}(0, C(t,t'; \bm{\theta}_t))  \\
  \omega(\bm{s}) &\sim& \text{GP}(0, C(\bm{s},\bm{s}'; \bm{\theta}_s)) .
\end{eqnarray*}

The spatial and temporal errors are usually assumed to follow Gaussian Processes with mean 0 and covariance $C(\cdotp, \cdotp; \bm{\theta})$. The spatial covariance can be modelled with any spatial form such as: $C(\bm{s},\bm{s}'; \bm{\theta}_s) = C(h)_{\text{Mat\'{e}rn}}$. Similarly, the temporal covariance can be formulated as any autocorrelation model such as: $C(t,t'; \bm{\theta}_t) = \sigma^2_t \exp(-\phi_t |t-t'|)$, or if discrete in time: $\text{AR(1)}: \upsilon(t+1)=\rho_t \upsilon(t) + \eta(t)$ with $\eta(t) \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0,\sigma^2_t)$, \textit{etc}.


While computationally appealing, even in this simple case of "separable" models, an evaluation of the likelihood requires the inverse $\Sigma^{-1}_{n\times n}$ which happens to scale with $O(n^3)$ operations. This has been a strong bottleneck to further development of these covariance-based methods in large scaled problems of space and space-time. Approximations have been suggested to overcome this crippling numerical problem: modeling the spatial process $\omega(s)$ with a lower dimensional process via kernel convolutions, moving averages, low rank splines/basis functions and predictive processes (projection of spatial process onto a smaller subset) (\cite{solna1996time}, \cite{wikle1999dimension}, \cite{hung2004decadal}, \cite{xu2005kernel}, \cite{banerjee2014hierarchical}); approximating the spatial process as a Markov random field with Laplace and SPDE Approximations \parencite{rinla:2015}; and approximating the likelihood of the spatial-temporal SPDE process with a spectral domain process \parencite{sigrist2015stochastic}. 

In this framework, we focus upon \textcite{sigrist2015stochastic}'s approach due to the more realistic assumption of non-separability of space and time processes and the high computational performance of operating in spectral space. Specifically, the space-time error $\omega(\bm{s},t)$ in Equation \ref{eq:spacetimeModel} is formulated as an advection-diffusion process (SPDE):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:adevectionDiffsionSPDE}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \omega(\bm{s},t) = - \bm{u}^T \nabla \omega(\bm{s},t)
+ \nabla \cdotp \Sigma \nabla \omega(\bm{s},t) - \zeta  \omega(\bm{s},t) + \epsilon(\bm{s},t).
\end{equation}

Here, $\bm{s}=(x,y)^T \in \Re^2$: $\bm{u}=(u_x, u_y)^T$ parameterizes the drift velocity (advection); $\nabla = \Big( \frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \Big)^T$  is the gradient operator;  $\nabla \cdotp \bm{F} = \Big( \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial y} \Big)^T$ is the divergence operator for a given vector field $\bm{F}=(F_x, F_y)^T$; $\Sigma^{-1} = \frac{1}{\phi^{2}_{d} }    
  \Big( 
  \begin{array}{cc}
  \cos \alpha & sin \alpha \\ 
  - \gamma \cdot \sin \alpha & \gamma \cdot \cos \alpha
  \end{array} 
  \Big)^T 
  \Big( 
  \begin{array}{cc}
  \cos \alpha & sin \alpha \\ 
  - \gamma \cdot \sin \alpha & \gamma \cdot \cos \alpha
  \end{array} 
  \Big) $ parameterizes the anisotropy in diffusion via ($\gamma > 0$, $\alpha \in [0,\pi/2]$) with $\phi_d > 0$  parameterizing the diffusion range; $\zeta > 0$ parameterizing local damping; and $\epsilon(\bm{s},t)$ parameterizing a Gaussian random field that accounts for source-sink processes with white noise in time and Mat\'{e}rn spatial covariance (aka, "innovation").
  
  
The full advection-diffusion model specification in state space form is  \parencite{sigrist2015stochastic}:
  
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    Y(\bm{s},t) &=& x(\bm{s},t)^{T} \bm{\beta} +  \omega(\bm{s},t) + \varepsilon(\bm{s},t) \\
    \omega(\bm{s},t) &=& \bm{\Phi} \bm{\alpha} (\bm{s},t)  \quad \text{\{discretized advection-diffusion process\}}\\
    \alpha (\bm{s},t)&=& \bm{G} \bm{\alpha} (\bm{s},t-1) + \hat{\epsilon}(\bm{s},t)  \quad \text{\{transition model\}} \\
    \varepsilon(\bm{s},t) &\sim& N(\bm{0}, \tau^2 \bm{1} ) \quad \text{\{unstructured error\}}\\
    \hat{\epsilon}(\bm{s},t) &\sim& N(\bm{0}, \bm{\hat{Q}})  \quad \text{\{innovation\}}\\
  \end{eqnarray*}  
  
  % $t \geq 0$ and $s \in [0,1]^2$ is wrapped on a torus.
  where, $\bm{\alpha} (\bm{s},t)$ are Fourier coefficients; $\bm{\Phi}=[ \bm{\phi}(\bm{s}_1), \dots, \bm{\phi}(\bm{s}_N) ]^T$ is a matrix of spatial basis functions; $\bm{G}$ is the transition matrix; and $\bm{\hat{Q}}$ is the innovation covariance matrix (residual errors). See Appendix \ref{advectionDiffsionSPDEsolution} for more details.
  
  
Once the form of the space-time model is formulated, it can be used as a predictive/interpolating method. Such interpolation is required to describe and understand the linkages between the key ecosystem attributes of productivity, biodiversity, habitat, and  species of interest as well as to estimate the spatial and temporal scales. 

We use an R-package implementation of the above space and space-time methods that interfaces with the data structures identified in Section \ref{sec:data}, "lattice based models" (\textit{stmv},  \url{https://bitbucket.org/ecomod/stmv}) to permit localised, hierarchical, model-based interpolations, for a given (local) subdomain indexed by $\lambda$. Note that, $\mu$ indicates a global regressor in a linear, nonlinear or binomial functional form $f$, and $\mu_\lambda$ represents a local regressor specific to the subdomain $\lambda$. The model specifications for each data series are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item bathymetry (pure space model): 
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    Y_\lambda(\bm{s}) &=& \omega_\lambda(\bm{s}) + \varepsilon_\lambda(\bm{s}) \\
    \omega_\lambda(\bm{s}) &\sim& \textrm{GP}(0, C(\bm{s},\bm{s}'; \bm{\theta}_\lambda))  \\
    \varepsilon_\lambda(\bm{s}) &\sim& \textrm{N}( \bm{0}, \tau_\lambda(\bm{s})^2) 
  \end{eqnarray*}
   
\item substrate grainsize (space with covariates): 
  \begin{eqnarray*}
   Y_\lambda(\bm{s}) &=& \mu(\bm{s}) + \omega_\lambda(\bm{s}) + \varepsilon_\lambda(\bm{s}) \\
   \mu(\bm{s}) &=& f ( \text{ depth, slope, curvature } ) \\
   \omega_\lambda(\bm{s}) &\sim& \textrm{GP}(0, C(\bm{s},\bm{s}'; \bm{\theta}_\lambda))  \\
   \varepsilon_\lambda(\bm{s}) &\sim& \textrm{N}(\bm{0}, \tau_\lambda(\bm{s})^2) 
 \end{eqnarray*}
  
\item bottom temperature (temporal effects nested in sites): 
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  Y_\lambda(\bm{s},t) &=& \mu(\bm{s}) + \omega_\lambda(\bm{s}) + \varepsilon_\lambda(\bm{s}) \\
  \mu(\bm{s}) &=& f ( \text{ depth } ) \\
  \omega_\lambda(\bm{s},t) &=& \bm{\Phi}_\lambda \bm{\alpha}_\lambda (\bm{s},t)  \\
  \alpha_\lambda(\bm{s},t)&=& \bm{G}_\lambda \bm{\alpha}_\lambda (\bm{s},t-1) + \hat{\epsilon}_\lambda(\bm{s},t)  \\
  \varepsilon_\lambda(\bm{s},t) &\sim& N(\bm{0}, \tau_\lambda^2 \bm{1} )  \\
  \hat{\epsilon}_\lambda(\bm{s},t) &\sim& N(\bm{0}, \bm{\hat{Q}}_\lambda)  
  \end{eqnarray*}

\item ecosystem indicators (including integrative habitat $H_i$; temporal effects nested in sites): 
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  Y_\lambda(\bm{s},t) &=& \mu(\bm{s}) + \mu_\lambda(\bm{s},t) + \omega_\lambda(\bm{s}) + \varepsilon_\lambda(\bm{s}) \\
  \mu(\bm{s}) &=& f ( \text{ depth, slope, curvature, substrate grainsize } ) \\
  \mu_\lambda(\bm{s},t) &=& f_\lambda ( \text{ temperature } ) \\
  \omega_\lambda(\bm{s},t) &=& \bm{\Phi}_\lambda \bm{\alpha}_\lambda (\bm{s},t)  \\
  \alpha_\lambda(\bm{s},t) &=& \bm{G}_\lambda \bm{\alpha}_\lambda (\bm{s},t-1) + \hat{\epsilon}_\lambda(\bm{s},t)  \\
  \varepsilon_\lambda(\bm{s},t) &\sim& N(\bm{0}, \tau_\lambda^2 \bm{1} )  \\
  \hat{\epsilon}_\lambda(\bm{s},t) &\sim& N(\bm{0}, \bm{\hat{Q}}_\lambda)  
\end{eqnarray*}

\item abundance and functional habitat ($H_f$; temporal effects nested in sites): 
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  Y_\lambda(\bm{s},t) &=& \mu(\bm{s}) + \mu_\lambda(\bm{s},t) + \omega_\lambda(\bm{s}) + \varepsilon_\lambda(\bm{s}) \\
  \mu(\bm{s}) &=& f ( \text{ depth, slope, curvature, substrate grainsize } ) \\
  \mu_\lambda(\bm{s},t) &=& f_\lambda ( \text{ temperature, ecosystem indicators } ) \\
  \omega_\lambda(\bm{s},t) &=& \bm{\Phi}_\lambda \bm{\alpha}_\lambda (\bm{s},t)  \\
  \alpha_\lambda (\bm{s},t) &=& \bm{G}_\lambda \bm{\alpha}_\lambda (\bm{s},t-1) + \hat{\epsilon}_\lambda(\bm{s},t)  \\
  \varepsilon_\lambda(\bm{s},t) &\sim& N(\bm{0}, \tau_\lambda^2 \bm{1} )  \\
  \hat{\epsilon}_\lambda(\bm{s},t) &\sim& N(\bm{0}, \bm{\hat{Q}}_\lambda) 
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tagging, mark-recapture}

A tangible way of quantifying time and space scales (connectivity) is to demonstrate movement and genetic similarity. In the latter, no effort has been made.  In the former, due to synergies with the fishing industry, increased tagging efforts have been made in the vicinity of SAB. Most of the effort has been driven by industry, Ocean Tracking Network (OTN), and Emera interest in snow crab movement near SAB (see Section~\ref{se:snowcrab}). However, acoustic tagging of other species of interest have been completed as well. In total, 80 tags were deployed: 58 cod, 14 Atlantic Striped Wolffish, 1 Shorthorn Sculpin and 7 Snow crab. These tags will allow us to track these species over the coming years within the MPA (through the two existing receiver lines) as well as outside the MPA with other OTN receiver lines and potentially with an OTN glider; and help define the spatial connectivity and range of the species of interest. The intent is to develop movement models where possible and estimate spatial range directly.  

Mark-recapture information for sea turtles, seals, sharks and various other species exist in the area. These data have not been examined nor are they always available and represent a data gap at present. 


\subsection{Risk modeling}
\label{sec:riskapproach}

Risk means many things to many people. We use the term specifically in the sense of having a believable error distribution for some quantity of interest such that probabilistic inferences can be made. Once the error distributions are determined, it is simple to make probablity statements related to how likely the current state is different from some previous state or arbitrary threshold. 

The estimation of such error distributions requires a reliable method to propagate the errors from observations to predictions. One venerable (\textbf{deterministic}) method is to build a mechanistic model and then using approximations or simulations to determine the error distributions of interest. A second (\textbf{phenomenological}) method empirically quantifies the errors and propagates them via statistical/correlational methods. The latter is chosen in this framework as it is very general and simple to implement. The former is not chosen as no operating model of an ecosystem nor any subcomponent is known to the authors that can be said to be able to perform with sufficient skill to be able to propagate errors, let alone, magnitudes. 

The proposed approach is to use the discrete form of the logistic equation for this purpose. Verhulst, Pearl and Lotka in the late 1800s and early 1900s popularized this equation, using it to describe patterns of asymptotic increase (population growth, economic growth, etc). The model is sufficiently general that it can be readily applied most quantities of interest that show some dynamic behaviour, such as, for example: aggregate estimates of biomass (productivity), biodiversity (biodiversity change), habitat (habitat change). Similar techniques can be applied to the other indicators of interest and may be applied depending upon availability of time. The justification of why it can be so generally applied is developed in Appendix~\ref{sec:logisticModel}.

The discrete form the basic logistic equation is, after normalization to $K$, the "carrying capacity" (see Appendix~\ref{sec:logisticModel}):

\begin{equation} 
\label{eqLogisticDiscrete}
y_t  \approx r y_{t-1} (1 - y_{t-1} ).
\end{equation}

Perhaps the most powerful and flexible method of estimation of the parameters, $\theta=\{r,K\}$, is a state space representation where an additional observation model is added to connect observed indices $O$ to the unobserved and (usually unobservable) real system state $y$. The simplest such model is a linear scaling factor, $q$, though again others are possible, at the cost of more complexity: 

\begin{equation} 
\label{eqLogisticDiscreteStateSpace}
O_t = q y_t
\end{equation}


where, $\theta=\{r,K,q\}$.

The use of a Bayesian approach to solve the above nonlinear state space problem (Eqs. \ref{eqLogisticDiscrete}, \ref{eqLogisticDiscreteStateSpace}) is frequently used as it provides an opportunity to: have greater numerical stability; incorporate prior scientific knowledge in a formal manner; realistically propagate credible errors; estimate unobserved ("true") states; and simultaneously estimate model "process" errors and data "observation" errors. [Note that process errors ($\sigma^2_p$) are the uncertainties that feeds back into future states via error propagation -- e.g., via the recursive form of the logistic equation (i.e., errors in $y_{t+1}$ in the state space of $y_t$ vs $y_{t+1}$). They are important if predictive risk is being assessed. Observation errors ($\sigma^2_o$) refer to the uncertainties associated with measurement and observation (i.e., measurement/data-related errors of both variables in the state space of $y_t$ vs $y_{t+1}$).]

This latter ability is particularly important as parameter estimates and forecasts based on observation-only errors provide unrealistically optimistic (small and constant) error bounds; and parameter estimates and forecasts based on process-only errors expand rapidly into the future, resulting in potentially unrealistically pessimistic (large and usually growing) error bounds.

The posterior distribution of the parameters of interest, $\theta$, conditional upon the data were estimated via MCMC (Gibbs) sampling using the JAGS platform \parencite{Plummer03jags}. The JAGS model used for parameter estimation can be found at: \url{https://bitbucket.org/ecomod/aegis/blob/master/inst/mpa.r}

\subsection{Anthropogenic Threats}
Productivity, habitat and biodiversity monitoring is essential if one is to assess if MPAs are achieving their primary objectives. It is also essential to examine the anthropogenic threats in the St. Anns bank area and examine the cumulative impacts on productivity, habitat, biodiversity, and endangered or threatened species. From the data available we can examine trawling and dredging disturbances, exploitation of marine resources by fisheries, fishing-gear entanglement threats to marine mammals and sea turtles, and vessel collision threats due to marine traffic, and vessel-noise disturbances. Each threat can be normalised on a zero-one scale to compare the intensity of threats across the region and then weighted and combined to examine cumulative anthropogenic threats as in \textcite{coll:2012:mediterranean}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
 
Most analyses have not been completed. The effort so far has been to assimilate and develop the scaffolding to support the analyses and future monitoring and assessment. These headings are here mostly as place holders. However, some preliminary results can be reported upon to show direction. We highlight a few of these results but emphasize their very preliminary nature.

\subsection{Connectivity}

\subsubsection{Spatial scale}

This is a first attempt at describing the spatial scale of SAB and outlying areas. Essentially, $S_s$ represents the distance one must walk before one loses memory of where one started (arbitrarily defined at the 5\% level of autocorrelation). Using this level of similarity as the standard, depth variations are demonstrably patchy/clustered  (\ref{fig:spatialrangeBathy}). In the SAB area, there is a mixture of large autocorrelation scales (exp(6)=400 km)  in the north-east areas, while the south-west areas have spatial scales of approximately 20 km or less.

\clearpage

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{/home/jae/bio.data/aegis/oneoffs/range.bathy.jpg}
  \caption{First estimate of log(spatial range; km) based upon depth variations.}
    \label{fig:spatialrangeBathy}
\end{figure}

Recall that, if $S_s$ is small then short-range processes dominate (e.g., less mobile species, weakly dispersing, low currents, habitat heterogeneity at small scales).  If $S_s$ is large then broader/larger processes were influencing the productivity of the species (e.g., higher mobility or dispersal processes/current, and stronger spatial connectivity, habitat heterogeneity at larger scales). 

As an another example, snow crab densities suggest different spatial autocorrelation patterns (Figure \ref{fig:spatialrangeSnowcrab}), with the majority of core fishing grounds being in the range of 60-90 km in length scale. In the vicinity of SAB, these spatial scales decline to about 10-60 km. 

\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{A first estimate of $log_e$(spatial range; km) of snow crab abundance variations.}
  \label{fig:spatialrangeSnowcrab}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Temporal scale}

Similar to spatial scale, we have defined temporal scale ($S_t$) as the time required to reach a state where autocorrelation drops to an insignificant level (5\%). Recall that if $S_t$ is small, short-range variations dominate (higher sampling effort to resolve/describe). If $S_t$ is large, long-range variations dominate (lower sampling effort required to resolve/describe). No analytical results are available for presentation at this time.



\subsubsection{Tagging}

No analytical results are available for presentation at this time beyond the overviews in: \url{http://www.enssnowcrab.com/mpa/mpatows.kmz}



\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
No discussions are forthcoming until more analysis can be completed.

\section{Conclusions and Recommendations}
\label{sec:conclusions}

% One can resolve spatial temporal variations with increase intensity of effort. But more important is the ability to say, some given level of resolution is sufficient. What are the space time scales that interest us, must therefore be made explicit.

This report was an exercise in demonstrating what is available and possible. All methods discussed are viable and informative and so should serve as a strong basis for any future monitoring framework in SAB and MPAs in general.

\section{Data quality control of AZMP data}

All data extraction, quality control and processing methods are documented in R scripts found in https://bitbucket.org/ecomod/aegis/.

\subsection{Discrete bottle data}

BioChem data are generally not subject to any quality control (QC). As such, substantial QC was required. The QC protocol used was based on procedures designed at DFO's Institut Maurice-Lamontagne (IML). These were in turn was based on procedures developed by NOAA's National Oceanographic Data Center/World Ocean Database (Conkright \textit{et al}. 2002) as well as many of the tests proposed in the GTSPP Real-Time Quality Control Manual (Unesco 1990). The quality control procedure was as follows:

\textbf{Step 1: Impossible dates}

Due to known issues with dates, database query for nutrients and chlorophyll were designed to extract records for which the sampling date is within start and end dates of the mission. Another check includes comparing HEADER\_START and EVENT\_START dates which should be the same. It is often found that month and day were reversed in EVENT\_START field. Those records were retained and HEADER\_START was used as a more reliable date.

\textbf{Step 2: Quality control flags}

Small number of records in BioChem was subject to quality control and  include flags for position (POSITION\_QC\_CODE) and data (DATA\_QC\_CODE). The meaning of the codes are as follows:

\begin{table} [h]
\begin{tabular}{ll}
0 & No quality control performed \\
1 & Value appears correct \\
2 & Value appears inconsistent \\
3 & Value appears doubtful \\
4 & Value  appears erroneous \\
5 & Value changed as result of quality control \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

QC flags were checked for parameter and inconsistent (2), doubtful (3) and erroneous (4) values were removed from the dataset.

\textbf{Step 3: Depth check}

For bottle data, start and end depth at which the water samples were collected are verified to be the same. Records with different start and end depths were removed from the dataset.

\textbf{Step 4: Duplicated records}

BioChem often contains duplicated records as same data was sometimes loaded into database twice and treated as different records. Duplicated records were removed and the first record of each duplicate is kept in the dataset.

\textbf{Step 4: Suspect missions}

Missions with suspect data were identified and removed. Those missions often show unusual data values (for example, integer numbers without decimal places with only some values out of range) suggesting that the data for the whole mission might be compromised. The suspect mission for each parameter are following:

\begin{table} [h]
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
	Chlorophyll-a & OC7908, 32G879008 \\
  Phosphate & 18HU88026 \\
  Silicate & 180167005, 31TR26870 \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}


\textbf{Step 5: Global impossible parameter values}

Chlorophyll and all nutrients values were examined if they fell within expected limits for NW Atlantic, which are adopted from IML quality control procedure (IML Test 2.1). The expected range of values are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Chlorophyll-a: 0-50 mg/m\textsuperscript{3}
  \item Nitrate: 0-515 mmol/m\textsuperscript{3}
  \item Phosphate: 0-4.5 mmol/m\textsuperscript{3}
  \item Silicate: 0-250 mmol/m\textsuperscript{3}
\end{itemize}

Any values outside of expected range were removed for open ocean data only. Coastal data ( up to 5km from the coast) were not filtered using expected ranges as in coastal water chlorophyll-a and nutrients concentrations can be higher. 

\textbf{Step 6: Profile envelope}

Data  for each parameter are checked if they fall within the expected limits by depth interval, as shown in Table~\ref{table:BioChemQC} (IML Test 2.4). This test does not allow zero values for silicate and phosphate in the deep water. Again, only open ocean data were subject to the profile envelope test.

\begin{table}[h]
\label{table:BioChemQC}
\caption{Expected ranges of parameters for the profile envelope test (IML Test 2.4)}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Parameter & Depth interval & Expected Range \\
\hline
Chlorophyll-a & 0-1500 m & 0-50 mg/m$^{3}$ \\
Silicate & 0-150 m & 0-250 mmol/m$^{3}$ \\
Silicate & 150-900 m & 0.01-250 mmol/m$^{3}$ \\
Phosphate & 0-500 m & 0-4.5 mmol/m$^{3}$ \\
Phosphate & 150-1500 m & 0.01-4.5 mmol/m$^{3}$ \\
Nitrate & 0-1500 m & 0-515 mmol/m$^{3}$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\textbf{Step 7: Impossible profiles}

This check was not implemented in the code and impossible profiles were identified by investigating unusual outliers.

Additional steps from IML QC procedure such as checks for constant profile, excessive gradient and inversions were not implemented in this quality control procedure. However, due to eutrophication from terrestrial sources, phosphate levels in coastal regions often exceeded the upper limits for globally and locally possible values, with the phosphate concentrations sometimes six times higher than the upper limits for the NW Atlantic in offshore waters. Therefore coastal and open ocean data were examined separately, non-coastal data were filtered using the expected limits for the NW Atlantic. Coastal data were defined as the ones collected less than 5 km away from the coast, where 5 km limit was chosen as an optimal distance at which all coastal inlets are included. Buffer polygons along the coastline were created (Figure~\ref{fig:aoiBuffer}) and used for flagging the data as open ocean records (flag 1) and coastal records (flag 2).

\subsection{Chlorophyll-a}

Chlorophyll-a data are derived from four methods. The methods are listed and described in Table~\ref{table:ChlaMethods} and the aggregate time series  associated with each method is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ChlaTimeseries}. For most of the chlorophyll data the method is not specified (unknown); Holm-Hansen fluorometric method is the standard AZMP method and is the second most frequent; Welschmeyer fluorometric method is used least frequently, often by the Quebec and Newfoundland regions.

In a number of cases, the same water sample was processed using two different methods, resulting in two sets of chlorophyll estimates for the same samples. Comparisons between these two sets of values are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ChlaComparison}. In both cases chlorophyll-a estimated by the Welschmeyer method are lower than the ones using the Holm-Hansen method or "unknown" method. Since there is more data mapped to the Holm-Hansen method than to the Welschmeyer method, only data derived from Chl\_a and Chl-a\_Holm\_Hansen\_sF methods were retained. No corrections were applied to correct for differences in methodology.

\subsection{Nitrate}

Nitrate estimates are derived from 10 methods. The methods are listed and described in Table~\ref{table:Nmethods} and the time series of data associated with each method is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:NTimeseries}. Most of the methods measure nitrate and nitrite together. We also included data for nitrate only since  in most seawater the concentration of nitrite is small compared to that of nitrate.

\subsection{Zooplankton}

Zooplankton data was extracted from DFO's BioChem database (\cite{DFO:2014:biochem}) from 1914 to 2014. They were comprised of 687 missions and 53,787 samples, using 13 different kind of nets, 35 different mesh sizes ranging from 20 microns to 4.23 mm, and various net deployment and sample processing protocols. To ensure data consistency and comparability, only samples collected and analyzed using Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program (AZMP) protocol (Mitchell \textit{et al}. 2002) were retained for study, reducing the time scope to 1999-2014. 

As AZMP samples are not always properly flagged in the BioChem database, a list of missions that followed the AZMP protocol were provided by Ocean and Ecosystem Science Division (OESD) and Ocean Data and Information Services (ODIS). The relevant missions include AZMP spring and fall cruises, summer and winter groundfish survey missions, bi-weekly sampling at fixed stations (Halifax Station 2 and Prince 5) and samples collected on the Scotian Shelf during Labrador Sea missions. 

AZMP protocol samples zooplankton with Ring nets (0.75 m diameter,mesh size of 202 um) deployed as vertical tows from either near bottom or 1000 m (whichever is shallower) to the surface. The sample analysis includes estimation of abundance, species composition and biomass in terms of wet and dry weight in two size fractions; one for organisms ranging from 0.2 mm to 10 mm in size and the other for all organisms larger than 10 mm.  The protocol is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Organisms larger than 10 mm are manually separated from the sample, identified and counted. Wet weight is determined and reported for each individual species. In addition total wet weight for all large organisms is reported as the sum of all individual wet weights.
  \item Captured organisms smaller than 10 mm (0.2 - 10 mm fraction), are identified and counted. Dry and wet weight is determined and reported for the whole sample, containing all organisms in that size fraction.
  \item Total wet weight is reported for all captured organisms as the sum of wet weights of large and small organisms.
  \item Developmental stages are identified for \textit{Calanus finmarchicus}, \textit{C. glacialis} and \textit{C. hyperboreus}. 
\end{itemize}


Since the data hosted in BioChem is generally not subject to quality control and can contain erroneous records substantial quality control was conducted to ensure correct representation of actual measurements. The quality control included verification of the following fields: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item time stamps: comparing mission dates with header dates and event dates 
  start and end depths of the nets that cannot be equal or close together
  \item volume of the samples: all records with volumes 0, or NA were removed
  \item split fraction of the sample: all the records with split fraction NA, 0 or $>$ 1 were removed 
  \item minimum and maximum sieve for dry weight records: records NA sieve were removed
  \item repeated records 
\end{itemize}


Finally the numerical and biomass density for each species per unit surface area of a tow was computed as follows: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{abundance} &=& \text{counts} \times \frac{  abs( \text{depth}_{\text{start}} - \text{depth}_{\text{end}} ) } { \text{split fraction} \times \text{volume} } \; \; [\text{individuals}/ \text{m}^{2} ]  \\
\text{biomass} &=& \text{weight} \times \frac{ abs( \text{depth}_{\text{start}} - \text{depth}_{\text{end}} )} { \text{split fraction} \times \text{volume}} \; \; [\text{g}/\text{m}^2],
\end{eqnarray*}

where counts refer to number of organisms encountered in the sample, $\text{depth}_{\text{start}}$ and $\text{depth}_{\text{end}}$ to the start and end depth of the net deployment, split fraction to the fraction of the sample analyzed and volume to the sample volume. The final filtered dataset includes 126 missions in the time period 1999 to 2014, with 2,367 net deployments and more than 400 taxonomic species. 

\section{Mat\'{e}rn function}
\label{sec:matern}

The Mat\'{e}rn \textit{correlation} function (Figure \ref{fig:matern_acf}) is parameterised in several ways and nomenclature of variables have also been inconsistent and can potentially cause confusion. The geoR library \parencite{diggle:2007, ribeiro:2001} defines it as:

\begin{equation}
    \rho(x) = \frac{1}{2^{\kappa-1} \Gamma(\kappa)}
    {\left( \frac{x}{\phi} \right)  }^{\kappa} K_{\kappa}\left( \frac{x}{\phi} \right),
\end{equation}

where, $\phi > 0$ is the "range parameter";  $\kappa > 0$ is the shape (smoothness) parameter; $K_{\kappa}()$ is the modified Bessel function of the third kind of order $\kappa$; and $\Gamma()$ is the Gamma function. It is also related to the fractal dimension of the surface complexity (\cite{Schepers:2002:fractals, constantine:1994}). 

spBayes's \parencite{finley:2007} parameterization just a little different as well as is the nomenclature:

\begin{equation}
\rho(x) = \frac{ 1 }{ 2^{\nu-1} \; \Gamma(\nu) }  \left( \phi x \right) ^{\nu} K_{\nu} \left( \phi x  \right). 
\end{equation}


INLA's \parencite{rinla:2015} parameterization is the same as spBayes', but nomenclature is slightly different again:

\begin{equation}
  \rho(x) = \frac{ 1 }{ 2^{\lambda-1} \; \Gamma(\lambda) }  \left( \kappa x \right) ^{\lambda} K_{\lambda} \left( \kappa x  \right) .
\end{equation}

Thus, the following identities are important to interpret the discussions and outputs from these authors:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \kappa_{geoR} &\equiv& \nu_{spBayes}  \equiv  \lambda_{INLA} \\
  1/\phi_{geoR} &\equiv& \phi_{spBayes} \equiv \kappa_{INLA}.
\end{eqnarray*}


Additionally, INLA defines $range_{13\%} = \sqrt{8 \lambda} / \kappa$. The following adopts the notation used by INLA.

The Mat\'{e}rn \textit{covariance} function, $\gamma(x)$ is the correlation function $\rho(x)$ scaled by the variance. An offset of $\tau^2$ the variability at local scales associated with sampling error smaller than the unit of measurement (sometimes called "nugget" variance) is also modeled:

\begin{equation*}
\gamma(x) = \tau^2 + \sigma^2 ( 1- \rho(x)) .
\end{equation*}


When $\nu_{spBayes} = 1/2$, this become the exponential model. When $\nu_{spBayes}  \rightarrow \infty$, the model becomes the Gaussian model. The curves become only incrementally different once $\nu_{spBayes} > 2$ and so \textcite{finley:2007} suggests limiting the prior to the interval (0,2) as a pragmatic solution to speeding up MCMC convergence. We have used the interval $\nu_{spBayes}= (0,5)$, just to be sure. 

Further, the effective range of spatial dependence (distance at which the correlation drops to 0.05 is given by $-ln(0.05)/\phi_{spBayes}$ \parencite{finley:2007}. As such, they recommend a uniform prior in the interval of ($\phi_{spBayes}, -ln(0.05)$). 

The spatial scale we define as exactly this practical or effective spatial range: the distance at which spatial dependence drops asymptotically to $\rho(x) \rightarrow 0.05$. To clarify, it should be noted that INLA defines this effective range at $\sqrt{8}/\phi_{spBayes}$ which is the approximate distance where the correlation falls to 0.13 (vs 0.05) because of eq. \ref{eq:inlaRange}. 

This Mat\'{e}rn covariance happens to be the stationary solution to the SPDE:

\begin{equation}
(\kappa^2 - \Delta)^{\alpha/2} ( \tau \xi(s)) = W(s),
\end{equation}

where $W(s)$ is Gaussian spatial white noise and $\tau$ controls the variance and $\kappa$ is the scale parameter. More precisely,

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
    \lambda  &=  \alpha - d/2 \\
    \sigma^2 &=  \frac{\Gamma(\lambda)}{\Gamma(\alpha)(4\pi)^{d/2}{\kappa}^{2\lambda} \tau^2 },
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

which for d=2 dimensions:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
\lambda  &=  \alpha - 1 \\
\sigma^2 &=  \frac{\Gamma(\lambda)}{\Gamma(\alpha)(4\pi){\kappa}^{2\lambda} \tau^2 },
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

and $\alpha=2$ by default and so $\lambda=1$ such that:


\begin{equation}
\label{eq:inlaRange}
\begin{cases}
  range    &=  \sqrt{8} / \kappa \\
  \sigma^2 &=  \frac{1}{4 \pi \kappa^2 \tau^2 },
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
 

\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{range} = \sqrt{8} / \kappa .
\end{eqnarray*} 





\section{Advection-diffusion Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE)}
\label{advectionDiffsionSPDEsolution}



Following the development of \textcite{sigrist2015stochastic}, we being with the general regression model

\begin{equation}
Y(\bm{s},t) = \mu(\bm{s},t) + e(\bm{s},t) ,
\end{equation}

where, $\mu(\bm{s},t) = x(\bm{s},t)^{T} \beta(\bm{s},t)$ is the mean process and $e(\bm{s},t)$ the residual error. This error process can be separated into a spatiotemporally structured component $\omega$ and an unstructured component $\varepsilon$: $e(\bm{s},t) = \omega(\bm{s},t) +  \varepsilon(\bm{s},t)$. The \textit{unstructured} error is usually assumed to be a white error process: $\varepsilon(\bm{s},t) \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\varepsilon)$. 

The structured error $\omega(\bm{s},t)$ can be defined in terms of the following advection-diffusion SPDE:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \omega(\bm{s},t) = - \bm{u}^T \nabla \omega(\bm{s},t)
+ \nabla \cdotp \Sigma \nabla \omega(\bm{s},t) - \zeta  \omega(\bm{s},t) + \epsilon(\bm{s},t),
\end{equation}

where, $\bm{s}=(x,y)^T \in \Re^2$: $\bm{u}=(u_x, u_y)^T$ parameterizes the drift velocity (advection); $\nabla = \Big( \frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \Big)^T$  is the gradient operator;  $\nabla \cdotp \bm{F} = \Big( \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial y} \Big)^T$ is the divergence operator for a vector field $\bm{F}=(F_x, F_y)^T$; $\Sigma^{-1} = \frac{1}{\phi^{2}_{d} }    
\Big( 
\begin{array}{cc}
\cos \alpha & sin \alpha \\ 
- \gamma \cdot \sin \alpha & \gamma \cdot \cos \alpha
\end{array} 
\Big)^T 
\Big( 
\begin{array}{cc}
\cos \alpha & sin \alpha \\ 
- \gamma \cdot \sin \alpha & \gamma \cdot \cos \alpha
\end{array} 
\Big) $ parameterizes the anisotropy in diffusion via ($\gamma > 0$, $\alpha \in [0,\pi/2]$) with $\phi_d > 0$  parameterizing the diffusion range; $\zeta > 0$ parameterizing local damping; and $\epsilon(\bm{s},t)$ parameterizing a Gaussian random field that accounts for source-sink processes with white noise in time and Mat\'{e}rn spatial covariance (aka, "innovation").

If $\epsilon(\bm{s},t)$ is stationary and has the form of a Whittle spatial covariance function, then it has the following spectrum:

\[
\tilde{f}(\bm{k}) = \frac {\sigma^2} {(2 \pi)^2} 
\Bigg(  
\bm{k}^T\bm{k} + \frac{1}{\phi_s^2}
\Bigg)^{-(\nu+1)},
\] 

where $\bm{k}$ are the spatial wave numbers. The spectrum of  the $\omega(\bm{s},t)$ process is then:
\[
f(w,\bm{k}) = \tilde{f}(\bm{k}) \frac {1} {(2 \pi)} 
\Big(  
(\bm{k}^T \Sigma \bm{k} + \zeta)^2 + (w + \bm{u}^T \bm{k} )^2 
\Big)^{-1} ,
\] 

where $w$ is temporal frequency. The covariance function can be recovered as:

\begin{eqnarray}
  C(\bm{s},t) &=& \int f(w,k) \; exp(i \cdot tw ) \; exp(i \cdot \bm{s}'\bm{k} ) \; d\bm{k} dw \\
  &=& \int \tilde{f}(\bm{k}) \frac{exp(-i \cdot \bm{u}^T \bm{k} t - (\bm{k}^T \Sigma \bm{k} + \zeta) |t| )} {2(\bm{k}^T \Sigma \bm{k} + \zeta) } \, exp( i \cdot \bm{s}' \bm{k} ) \, d\bm{k} .
\end{eqnarray}  


Upon discretization:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \omega(\bm{s},t)  &=& \bm{\phi}(\bm{s})^T \alpha(t) \\
    &\approx& \sum_{j=1}^{K} \phi_j(\bm{s}) \alpha_j(t)   \\
    &\approx& \sum_{j=1}^4 \phi_j^{(cos)} (\bm{s}_l) \alpha_j^{(cos)}(t) 
    + \sum_{j=5}^{K/2+2} (  \phi_j^{(cos)} (\bm{s}_l )\alpha_j^{(cos)}(t) +   \phi_j^{(sin)} (\bm{s}_l ) \alpha_j^{(sin)}(t) ) ,
  \end{eqnarray*}  
  
  where $\bm{k}=(k_{x,j}, k_{y,j} )^T$ is the spatial wavenumber of the j component of K Fourier components and $\phi_j(\bm{s}) = \exp(\imath \cdot \bm{k}_j^T\bm{s} ) = \{ \cos( \bm{k}_j^T\bm{s}),  \sin( \bm{k}_j^T\bm{s} ) \}$ is the spatial function. And, for each time $t$ and location $s_l$, $l=1,\dots, n^2$ in the SPDE:
  
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \bm{u}^T \nabla \phi_j^{(cos)}(\bm{s}_l) &=& -\bm{u}^T \bm{k}_j \phi_j^{(sin)} (\bm{s}_l) \\
    \bm{u}^T \nabla \phi_j^{(sin)}(\bm{s}_l) &=& -\bm{u}^T \bm{k}_j \phi_j^{(cos)} (\bm{s}_l),
  \end{eqnarray*}  
 and, 
 
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \nabla \cdot \Sigma \nabla \phi_j^{(cos)}(\bm{s}_l) &=& -\bm{k}_j^T \Sigma \bm{k} \phi_j^{(cos)} (\bm{s}_l) \\
    \nabla \cdot \Sigma \nabla \phi_j^{(sin)}(\bm{s}_l) &=& -\bm{k}_j^T \Sigma \bm{k} \phi_j^{(sin)} (\bm{s}_l) .
  \end{eqnarray*}  


The full non-separable, advection-diffusion model specification is thus:

  \begin{eqnarray*}
    Y(\bm{s},t) &=& x(\bm{s},t)^{T} \bm{\beta} +  \omega(\bm{s},t) + \varepsilon(\bm{s},t) \\
    \omega(\bm{s},t) &=& \bm{\Phi} \bm{\alpha} (\bm{s},t)  \quad \text{\{advection-diffusion model\}}\\

\section{Interpretation of the logistic model}
\label{sec:logisticModel}

The derivation of the logistic model, presented below is more phenomenological than mechanistic and attributed to \textcite{lotka1925}. It is our opinion that this phenomenological interpretation renders it so useful as a general characterisation of system state. The argument is that the rate of change in time $t$ of any state $Y$ (in our context: abundance, species richness, "habitat", size) can be expected to be in some way, a function of itself:  

\begin{eqnarray} 
\label{eqLogisticContinuous}
dY / dt = g(Y).
\end{eqnarray}

It is expected that when $Y = 0$, $dY/dt$ will also be zero and so represents an algebraic root of $g$. A Taylor series expansion of $g$ near this root $Y=0$ gives:

\begin{eqnarray*} 
  \label{eqLogisticTaylorSeries}
  dY / dt &=&  g'(0) Y + g''(0) Y^{2}/2  + \text{higher order terms} \dots; \\
  &\approx& Y [g'(0) + g''(0) Y/2  ].
\end{eqnarray*}


With the identities $g'(0) = r$  and $g''(0) = - 2r/K$, the standard form of the logistic equation is obtained:

\begin{equation} 
\label{eqLogistic}
dY/dt \approx r Y (1 - Y/K).
\end{equation}

The intrinsic rate of increase, $r$, is therefore, some abstract and aggregate function that describes the net increase or decrease of the system state $Y$ when $Y$ is small. In biological systems, this means a maximum rate of growth, recruitment, mortality, movement, climatic change, extinction, speciation, etc. as the rate is expected to decline as it approaches some upper limit $K$ of the magnitude of the system state $Y$.

With normalization by $K$ such that $ y = Y/K $:

\begin{equation} 
\label{eqLogisticBasic}
dy/dt  \approx  r y (1 - y).
\end{equation}

Many variations of this basic model are known, mostly different ways of adjusting the shape of the curve and/or the location of the inflection point (i.e., $K/2$). This is done by adding additional parameters in the form of exponentiation of different components which ultimately amounts to adding higher order and even fractional order terms in the Taylor series) and also adding additional terms $f(\dots)$ that are external to the dynamic that $r$ and $K$ govern, such as fishing, advection, diffusion, noise: 

\begin{eqnarray} 
\label{eqLogisticGeneral}
dy / dt &=& r y^{\alpha} ( 1 - y )^{\beta} + f(\dots).
\end{eqnarray}

The "$\dots$", above, indicate other factors or parameters influencing these "externalities" through the action of $f$. For the purposes of this discussion, we will use only the basic model and estimate the parameters of interest, $\theta = \{r, K \}$ (Eq. \ref{eqLogisticBasic}), but the reader should be aware that other parameterizations are possible such as Eq. \ref{eqLogisticGeneral}, at the expense of course, a slightly greater model complexity $\theta=\{r,K,\alpha,\beta\}$. The intent is to explore the utility of this more flexible formulation in conjunction with the basic model. 

In discrete form, where $\Delta t = 1 \; \text{year}$ and after a Euler discretization, the basic model becomes:

\begin{equation} 
\label{eqLogisticDiscrete:appendix}
y_t  \approx r y_{t-1} (1 - y_{t-1} ).
\end{equation}

This we will call the "basic" form of the discrete logistic model.
