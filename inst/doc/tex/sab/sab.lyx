Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
We begin the dialogue required to develop a framework for monitoring and assessing spatially managed areas such as Marine Protected Areas (MPA). In particular, we begin with the Ocean's Act requirement to describe productivity, biodiversity, habitat and species of interest by identifying pragmatic metrics of these ecosystem-level attributes from pre-existing monitoring systems in the area of interest: St. Anns Bank in the Maritimes Region of Canada. We also identify a few human influences/pressures that are also readily quantified, namely fishing and vessel activity and some of the data gaps that evident in the area. The nature of these data and the steps required to use them properly are made explicit in an open-sourced and revision-controlled environment (R and git) for the purpose of developing a transparent, vetted data and code system from which future assessment and modeling attempts can be staged. This should reduce the replication of effort in future. The rationale for the methods chosen to quantify the characteristic space and time scales of processes and features are identified and discussed. Ultimately, the intent is to develop approaches similar to the risk-based approach frequently encountered in fishery stock assessments, such that we can begin to express the "status" of an area or MPA. It is perhaps even possible to attempt to define reference points and obtain a better sense of the "health" of these areas, or at least assess the relative influence of area-based management closures. This first report will focus only upon the "Data" side of the issues and clarify the proposed "Methods".

\size large
An MPA is defined in the Oceans Act 35(1) as, "An area of the sea that forms part of the internal waters of Canada, the territorial sea of Canada or the exclusive economic zone of Canada and has been designated under this section for special protection for one or more of the following reasons:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
As a result, for the purposes of this report, we will likewise focus upon these key ecosystem attributes or components, namely: 
\series bold
productivity, biodiversity, habitat, and species of interest
\series default
. In reality, however, there are many other attributes or components of ecosystems that are also known to be important and relevant, including: ecological integrity and health, trophic structure and balance, ecosystem function, complexity, network structure, resilience, sustainability as well an open-ended number of species or life history stages of the resident species. These other components will be touched upon where possible or necessary.

Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The 
\series bold
primary objectives
\series default
 of this report are straightforward:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\size large
To develop an Assessment Framework that can: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\size large
monitor the status of an MPA; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\size large
assess the effectiveness of an MPA in meeting its conservation objectives; 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\size large
to identify data gaps and sources of uncertainty. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The method by which this can be accomplished, however, is anything but straightforward. This is primarily due to the fact that the SAB is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\size large
a large ecosystem and as such complex, operating at various space, time and organizational scales; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\size large
connected in various ways to the surrounding environment and so cannot be treated as an isolated system; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\size large
measures of system components of interest, namely, productivity, biodiversity, habitat and species of interest, are ambiguous and imperfect at best, and usually non-existent or poor in information quality and/or quantity. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
As such, we emphasize that this report is a simplistic first attempt at developing a general approach towards assessing MPAs. Indeed, given the above significant challenges, it is best viewed as a work in progress that will require further precision and improvement. To this end, we will in the following, describe the data used for the assessment (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:data"

\end_inset

); outline the methods and assumptions associated with the modeling of this data (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

); summarize the primary results of this analysis (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

); provide some discussion of salient points (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:discussion"

\end_inset

); and conclude with general recommendations (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:conclusions"

\end_inset

). The technical aspects of data quality assurance (QA)/quality control (QC), associated assumptions and methods are identified in the Appendices.

Discrete bottle data consisting of chlorophyll-a and nutrient records (nitrate, phosphate and silicate) were obtained by laboratory analysis of water samples collected at discrete depths. For this study all available nutrient and chlorophyll-a discrete bottle data were extracted from DFO's BioChem database for the study area. This dataset contains more than 500,000 records with the earliest records starting in 1955. After QA/QC, the discrete bottle data retained for analysis was comprised of 143,499 profiles, collected on 829 missions (Figure

The number of profiles available in each year (Figure
\begin_inset space ~

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) shows that there were few profiles taken until the mid 60's, and a relatively steady number of yearly profiles after the initiation of the Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program (AZMP) in 1999. The peak sampling during the period 1976-1982 corresponds to DFO's Scotian Shelf Ichthyoplankton Program (SSIP) and foreign research vessels sampling programs which were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Oceanographic Data Center (Pierre Clement, personal communication). Monthly distribution of the profiles (Figure
\begin_inset space ~

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ChloroFreq"

\end_inset

) demonstrates that most of the data was collected in July (mostly during DFO's groundfish surveys), followed by the months of September and April. Note that spatial distribution of the sampling varies among months with most data collected on the Scotian Shelf in July and the fewest data in January (Figures

Ocean colour satellite data for this study was provided by the Remote Sensing Unit (RSU) from the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO) as 8-day composite chlorophyll images which are routinely produced by the unit for the Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program (AZMP). The dataset was created using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua) data, where the chlorophyll-a values are based on the 2012 reprocessing carried by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) using OC3 chlorophyll algorithm. Composite images were created from daily Level-2 MODIS-Aqua files downloaded from NASA by averaging valid chlorophyll-a values for each pixel using all available daily images within that time period

Even though there is ocean color data available before MODIS launch it was decided to limit our dataset to a single sensor to avoid potential biases between the sensors. Due to the frequent cloud coverage of the NW Atlantic it was decided to use 8-day composite images as daily images would not provide sufficient number of valid pixels.

Sensors measuring trawl net configuration and state are ubiquitous in modern surveys and commercial fishing practices. In the snow crab survey, net configuration has been monitored and used to determine swept area manually (since 1996) and also with an automated procedure (since 2004). Unfortunately, in the groundfish survey, this information is ignored, even though the survey series is a major source of information for many stock assessments. Net configuration data have been collected in the groundfish surveys sporadically since 2004 (Figure

). However, swept area estimates have never been directly computed. Instead, the catch data is used almost invariably with the assumption that each tow is equivalent in swept area (a "standard tow"). Alternatively, it has also been used by some assessments by "adjusting" catch data by the linear distance from "start" and "end" times and locations and so implicitly assuming the net configuration to be a constant (Don Clarke, personal communication). Both approaches are problematic for the reasons identified below.

From this re-analysis, the actual time and distance of bottom contact was found to range from approximately 10 to 40 minutes and distances from 1.75 to 6 km, bringing into question many historical studies that assumed a "standard tow" of 3.24 km in length. Even when compared to the "length" of a tow, determined from positions recorded of "start" and "stop" times or locations were frequently in error relative to actual locations of net touch down and lift-off determined from GPS information (Figure

). Indeed, the range in variation of swept area was approximately the same in magnitude as the swept area of a standard tow! This means that an unnecessary and large "observation error", potentially as large in magnitude as the magnitude of the catch in a set, may be needlessly introduced to survey indices. Further, swept area estimates based upon standard tows were also biased down relative to estimates based upon net mensuration and actual tow tracks, meaning that there in a high probability of over-estimating catch densities.

Fourteen stations in, and adjacent to the proposed MPA location were included in this additional sampling.

Commercial-fishing activities can modify the habitat and ecosystem and contribute to changes in the structure and functioning of exploited marine communities. Fishing impacts can be direct, such as the reduction of targeted and non-targeted species, as well as truncations in age and size distributions. Other direct effects due to fishing activities include habitat alterations and substrate modifications through interactions with fishing gear. Fishing can also cause indirect impacts via changes in foodweb structure within an ecosystem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Direct impacts of commercial fishing can be measured using data form the Marine Fish (MARFIS) database that provides information on commercial-fishing activities. For most fisheries the fishing position, gear type, catch per unit effort, estimated weight of catch by species information is available from the database. The MARFIS database details information for all fishing trips, where a landing is reported within the DFO Maritimes region and includes data from 2002 through 2015. The exploitation of marine species and entanglement threat to cetaceans and sea turtles will be quantified from data derived from the MARFIS database.

Monitoring could be done through a variety of techniques and data sources, including data reported in the MARFIS database, Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data that allow the direct monitoring of fishing activities. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data may also be used to monitoring fishing activities if the vessel is large enough to require AIS (

Once data was extracted, it was processed through a second script,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
QC occurs in 2 stages, and is quite simple. First, all records without coordinates are identified and retained, but removed from the main dataset. Next, all remaining data is compared against a high resolution coastline (the same as is shown in Figure

\end_inset

), and those points falling on land are identified and retained, but removed from the main dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The remaining data are considered good, and these data is then aggregated. The aggregation level is user-defined, but will likely be a scale of 3 minutes since it is an even division of a degree, with no potential for rounding errors (i.e. 3' = 1/60*3 = 0.05 vs 2' = 0.03). The aggregation process outputs a single record with a single position for all of the catch in the area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Following aggregation, the proportion of the total catch attributable to each cell is calculated. The data that failed the QC tests are then summed into a single value, representing the total catch that can
\begin_inset Quotes ers

t be positioned. These data are then added to all of the cells in the same proportion as was calculated in the previous step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

For example, one cell might have a total catch of 3269.7 kg, and this cell represents 0.002167 of the total catch. If there are 5954.1 kgs of un-positioned data, then the

Direct effects including the contamination of the ecosystem from the discharge of contaminates, radiated underwater noise, the introduction of aquatic invasive species, and vessel-strike risk to marine mammals and sea turtles.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada has access to two different sources of AIS data. The first is from the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) terrestrial system that was developed to track and monitoring coastal shipping and provides a real-time, continuous stream of AIS vessel positions. Archived historical data from this system is available for January 2012 through December 2015 and data from 2016 is currently streaming and archiving to a server within DFO. Decoding routines have been developed using native R methods for these data. Both sources of data provide dynamic and static data, where the dynamic data includes information on vessel identity, speed, and location, and static data includes information vessel identity, name, size, and type.

) as AIS transmission detectability are primarily a function of the receiving tower height above sea level and the height of the AIS antenna on the transmitting vessel. AIS data is transmitted via Very High Frequency (VHF) marine radio on two channels (161.9765 and 162.025 MHz). Based on the height of the associated towers and a vessel with an AIS antenna 100 m high, line of sight calculations for VHF provide a reception range of 57 to 113 m in and around St. Anns Bank (Figure

). Grid resolution for this analysis was inially set to 0.01 degrees and within each grid square the number of unique vessels, identified by the vessel's Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number was counted daily and summed through time. Cost maps were estimated quarterly. Two different cost maps were developed for the St. Anns Bank area to interpolate vessel transits north of Cape Breton into and out of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Interpolation was heavily influenced by the ferries transiting between Cape Breton and Newfoundland, and therefore a cost map was developed without the data derived from these ferries. A bathymetric restriction can also be build into the cost maps.

For the purpose of determining any change in the diet of finfish pre- and post- implementation of the MPA on St. Anns Bank or if there were differences within the MPA compared to other areas on the Scotian shelf, we explored the stomach database to determine if these dietary differences could be described and detected. Within the database, 54% of the prey number observations were missing. Due to the large interannual variation in prey weights estimating the prey number consistently from non-missing data where both the prey number and weight was available was determined to be impracticable and unreliable. Due to the sampling stratification both by depth and length classes it was further determined that there would be insufficient samples available to reach the asymptote of prey species accumulation curves

Biodiversity and taxonomic richness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Biodiversity is seemingly a simple concept that is, in fact, fundamentally complex. This is because it ranges in focus from genetic and phenotypic variations within a local population, breeding populations to biome or even larger scaled genetic and phylogentic and community variability, both in terms of their number and relative dominance. Any and all of these aspects of biodiversity can be estimated. However, it is the number of unique kinds of organisms found in a given location (commonly called taxonomic richness) that is most readily quantified and monitored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Taxonomic richness is known to increase asymptotically with sampling intensity. As such, a statistical correction ("rarefaction") for spatial and temporal sampling intensity must be applied to be meaningfully comparable across locations and time. Specifically, the model was a simple regression model:

The basic Hutchinsonian notion of "ecological niche" is closely tied to our current understanding of "habitat".

A utilitarian way of describing 
\series bold
Functional-habitat
\series default
 space of an organism is to examine the presence-absence or relative abundance of organisms as a function of environmental gradients and biological/life history constraints. From such information, the likelihood of a given location to be potential habitat for an organism of interest can be derived. The simplest method is to develop a probability model under the assumption that the presence or absence of an organism is a Bernoulli process. This can be readily parameterised using standard Generalized Linear Models. However, as environmental constraints are almost always modal in influence given a wide enough environmental gradient, a nonlinear model is more useful. Generalized Additive Models and Autoregressive Models are two methods that can deal with these environmental constraints in a simple and efficient manner

The utility of such an approach is most relevant for organisms with highly specific habitat requirements. They are used in this framework.

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
MPAs exist in a spatial context. The characteristic spatial scale of productivity, diversity and habitat found in the MPA will determine which processes will be relevant to these aspects of an MPA. If the spatial variations in the productivity of a species of interest is small relative to the size of an MPA, the chances of the MPA having an influence upon the species is enhanced. This is usually the case when short-range processes dominate (e.g., less mobile species, weakly dispersing, low currents, habitat heterogeneity at small scales). If, however, the spatial scale is larger than the MPA, then it would mean that broader/larger processes were influencing the productivity of the species (e.g., higher mobility or dispersal processes/current, and stronger spatial connectivity, habitat heterogeneity at larger scales) – resulting in a lower likelihood of the MPA having an influence upon the species or components of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
A second important factor is the relationship of the characteristic spatial scale to monitoring. As organisms exist at a given spatial scale in a given area, a sampling/monitoring protocol must reference/address these spatial scales. For example, when a spatial feature (e.g., biodiversity) demonstrates short characteristic spatial scales (i.e., a lot of spatial structure at smaller scales), any sampling approach must respect this and similarly operate at such shorter scales or even smaller if one is to be able to resolve the patterns and describe properly the subject of interest. Similarly, if a feature (e.g., biodiversity) is long-ranged and one wishes to resolve the patterns properly, then a sampling protocol must be similarly long-ranged to resolve the pattern. A sampling program much smaller than the characteristic spatial scale would be beneficial, but the accrued benefits relative to cost of sampling would be rapidly diminishing, in that time, effort and resources requirements generally increase more rapidly than any benefit (e.g., in the simplest case, if one is looking only naively at standard error as a measure of benefit, then it would increase asymptotically with increased effort with a power of 
\begin_inset Formula $-1/2$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
For these fundamental reasons, defining the spatial scale of a given observation or process is imperative for the development of any assessment or monitoring of MPAs. To this end, we represent any spatially explicit observation as

\begin_inset Formula $d$

\begin_inset Formula $d=2$

 spatial dimensions (e.g., longitude and latitude or northing and easting). The observations

Sub-annual signals where they are available would be used to decompose the seasonal signals from the inter-annual signals to avoid bias due to discretization errors.

 In reality, spatial and temporal patterns coexist and evolve. They are correlated processes and as such a challenge to model properly ("nonseparable" – see below). This renders the independent treatment and estimation of autocorrelation in time and space problematic. Nonetheless, new developments in computational methods are bringing such models within range of use for a framework such as this.

In the former, due to synergies with the fishing industry, increased tagging efforts have been made in the vicinity of SAB.

These tags will allow us to track these species over the coming years within the MPA (through the two existing receiver lines) as well as outside the MPA with other OTN receiver lines and potentially with an OTN glider; and help define the spatial connectivity and range of the species of interest. The intent is to develop movement models where possible and estimate spatial range directly.

Risk means many things to many people. We use the term specifically in the sense of having a believable error distribution for some quantity of interest such that probabilistic inferences can be made. Once the error distributions are determined, it is simple to make probablity statements related to how likely the current state is different from some previous state or arbitrary threshold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The estimation of such error distributions requires a reliable method to propagate the errors from observations to predictions. One venerable (
\series bold
deterministic
\series default
) method is to build a mechanistic model and then using approximations or simulations to determine the error distributions of interest. A second (
\series bold
phenomenological
\series default
) method empirically quantifies the errors and propagates them via statistical/correlational methods. The latter is chosen in this framework as it is very general and simple to implement. The former is not chosen as no operating model of an ecosystem nor any subcomponent is known to the authors that can be said to be able to perform with sufficient skill to be able to propagate errors, let alone, magnitudes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The proposed approach is to use the discrete form of the logistic equation for this purpose. Verhulst, Pearl and Lotka in the late 1800s and early 1900s popularized this equation, using it to describe patterns of asymptotic increase (population growth, economic growth, etc). The model is sufficiently general that it can be readily applied most quantities of interest that show some dynamic behaviour, such as, for example: aggregate estimates of biomass (productivity), biodiversity (biodiversity change), habitat (habitat change). Similar techniques can be applied to the other indicators of interest and may be applied depending upon availability of time. The justification of why it can be so generally applied is developed in Appendix

[Note that process errors (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^2_p$

\begin_inset Formula $y_t$

This latter ability is particularly important as parameter estimates and forecasts based on observation-only errors provide unrealistically optimistic (small and constant) error bounds; and parameter estimates and forecasts based on process-only errors expand rapidly into the future, resulting in potentially unrealistically pessimistic (large and usually growing) error bounds.

Most analyses have not been completed. The effort so far has been to assimilate and develop the scaffolding to support the analyses and future monitoring and assessment. These headings are here mostly as place holders. However, some preliminary results can be reported upon to show direction.

Spatial scale
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
This is a first attempt at describing the spatial scale of SAB and outlying areas. Essentially, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_s$
\end_inset

 represents the distance one must walk before one loses memory of where one started (arbitrarily defined at the 5% level of autocorrelation). Using this level of similarity as the standard, depth variations are demonstrably patchy/clustered (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:spatialrangeBathy"

\end_inset

). In the SAB area, there is a mixture of large autocorrelation scales (exp(6)=400 km) in the north-east areas, while the south-west areas have spatial scales of approximately 20 km or less.

Recall that, if 
\begin_inset Formula $S_s$
\end_inset

 is small then short-range processes dominate (e.g., less mobile species, weakly dispersing, low currents, habitat heterogeneity at small scales). If 
\begin_inset Formula $S_s$
\end_inset

 is large then broader/larger processes were influencing the productivity of the species (e.g., higher mobility or dispersal processes/current, and stronger spatial connectivity, habitat heterogeneity at larger scales).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
As an another example, snow crab densities suggest different spatial autocorrelation patterns (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:spatialrangeSnowcrab"

\end_inset

), with the majority of core fishing grounds being in the range of 60-90 km in length scale. In the vicinity of SAB, these spatial scales decline to about 10-60 km.

Temporal scale

\begin_layout Standard

Similar to spatial scale, we have defined temporal scale (
\begin_inset Formula $S_t$
\end_inset

) as the time required to reach a state where autocorrelation drops to an insignificant level (5%). Recall that if 
\begin_inset Formula $S_t$
\end_inset

 is small, short-range variations dominate (higher sampling effort to resolve/describe). If 
\begin_inset Formula $S_t$
\end_inset

 is large, long-range variations dominate (lower sampling effort required to resolve/describe). No analytical results are available for presentation at this time.

BioChem data are generally not subject to any quality control (QC). As such, substantial QC was required. The QC protocol used was based on procedures designed at DFO's Institut Maurice-Lamontagne (IML). These were in turn was based on procedures developed by NOAA's National Oceanographic Data Center/World Ocean Database (Conkright

Due to known issues with dates, database query for nutrients and chlorophyll were designed to extract records for which the sampling date is within start and end dates of the mission. Another check includes comparing HEADER_START and EVENT_START dates which should be the same. It is often found that month and day were reversed in EVENT_START field. Those records were retained and HEADER_START was used as a more reliable date.

Additional steps from IML QC procedure such as checks for constant profile, excessive gradient and inversions were not implemented in this quality control procedure. However, due to eutrophication from terrestrial sources, phosphate levels in coastal regions often exceeded the upper limits for globally and locally possible values, with the phosphate concentrations sometimes six times higher than the upper limits for the NW Atlantic in offshore waters. Therefore coastal and open ocean data were examined separately, non-coastal data were filtered using the expected limits for the NW Atlantic. Coastal data were defined as the ones collected less than 5 km away from the coast, where 5 km limit was chosen as an optimal distance at which all coastal inlets are included. Buffer polygons along the coastline were created (Figure

In a number of cases, the same water sample was processed using two different methods, resulting in two sets of chlorophyll estimates for the same samples. Comparisons between these two sets of values are shown in Figure
\begin_inset space ~

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ChlaComparison"

\end_inset

. In both cases chlorophyll-a estimated by the Welschmeyer method are lower than the ones using the Holm-Hansen method or "unknown" method. Since there is more data mapped to the Holm-Hansen method than to the Welschmeyer method, only data derived from Chl_a and Chl-a_Holm_Hansen_sF methods were retained. No corrections were applied to correct for differences in methodology.

Zooplankton data was extracted from DFO's BioChem database (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "DFO:2014:biochem"

\end_inset

) from 1914 to 2014. They were comprised of 687 missions and 53,787 samples, using 13 different kind of nets, 35 different mesh sizes ranging from 20 microns to 4.23 mm, and various net deployment and sample processing protocols. To ensure data consistency and comparability, only samples collected and analyzed using Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program (AZMP) protocol (Mitchell 
\shape italic

. 2002) were retained for study, reducing the time scope to 1999-2014.

As AZMP samples are not always properly flagged in the BioChem database, a list of missions that followed the AZMP protocol were provided by Ocean and Ecosystem Science Division (OESD) and Ocean Data and Information Services (ODIS). The relevant missions include AZMP spring and fall cruises, summer and winter groundfish survey missions, bi-weekly sampling at fixed stations (Halifax Station 2 and Prince 5) and samples collected on the Scotian Shelf during Labrador Sea missions.

AZMP protocol samples zooplankton with Ring nets (0.75 m diameter,mesh size of 202 um) deployed as vertical tows from either near bottom or 1000 m (whichever is shallower) to the surface. The sample analysis includes estimation of abundance, species composition and biomass in terms of wet and dry weight in two size fractions; one for organisms ranging from 0.2 mm to 10 mm in size and the other for all organisms larger than 10 mm. The protocol is as follows:
